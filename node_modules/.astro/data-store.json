Every month feels like a financial scramble. He doesn't overspend on anything crazy — but somehow, there's never enough left over.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, the 50/30/20 rule might be exactly what you need. It's the simplest budgeting framework that actually works.\n\n## How the 50/30/20 Rule Works\n\nTake your monthly after-tax income and divide it into three buckets:\n\n**50% → Needs** — Things you must pay for to survive and function.\n\n**30% → Wants** — Things that improve your life but aren't essential.\n\n**20% → Savings & Debt** — Building your financial future.\n\nFor Marcus with $4,500/month:\n- Needs: $2,250\n- Wants: $1,350\n- Savings/Debt: $900\n\n## What Counts as a Need?\n\nNeeds are expenses you can't avoid. If you stopped paying, your life would genuinely be affected:\n\n- Rent or mortgage payment\n- Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet)\n- Groceries (basic food, not dining out)\n- Health insurance and medical costs\n- Car payment and gas (if needed for work)\n- Minimum debt payments\n- Basic phone plan\n- Childcare\n\n**The key test:** If you lost your job, would you still need to pay this to survive? If yes, it's a need.\n\n## What Counts as a Want?\n\nWants are everything that makes life enjoyable but isn't strictly necessary:\n\n- Dining out and takeout\n- Streaming subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify)\n- Gym membership\n- Shopping for clothes beyond basics\n- Vacations and travel\n- Hobbies and entertainment\n- Upgraded phone plan\n- That $6 daily latte\n\n**No judgment.** Wants aren't wasteful — they're part of a balanced life. The goal is keeping them within your 30% budget.\n\n## The 20% Savings and Debt Category\n\nThis is where wealth gets built:\n\n- Emergency fund (aim for 3-6 months of expenses)\n- 401(k) or IRA contributions\n- Extra debt payments (beyond minimums)\n- Investment accounts\n- Saving for major goals (house down payment, education)\n\n**Priority order:**\n1. Employer 401(k) match (free money — always take it)\n2. Emergency fund to $1,000\n3. Pay off high-interest debt (credit cards)\n4. Build emergency fund to 3-6 months\n5. Invest for retirement and other goals\n\n## Real Example: $60,000 Salary\n\nOn a $60,000 annual salary, your take-home pay is roughly $3,900/month (assuming standard deductions and taxes).\n\n| Category | Amount | Examples |\n|:---|:---:|:---|\n| Needs (50%) | $1,950 | Rent $1,200 + Utilities $150 + Groceries $300 + Insurance $200 + Gas $100 |\n| Wants (30%) | $1,170 | Dining $300 + Entertainment $150 + Subscriptions $50 + Shopping $200 + Gym $50 + Misc $420 |\n| Savings (20%) | $780 | 401k $400 + Emergency fund $200 + Extra debt payment $180 |\n\n## When 50/30/20 Doesn't Quite Fit\n\nThe framework may need adjusting based on your situation:\n\n**High cost of living:** In San Francisco or New York, rent alone might exceed 50%. Try 60/20/20 or 70/15/15. Focus on keeping savings at 15%+ minimum.\n\n**High debt load:** If you're aggressively paying off student loans or credit cards, try 50/20/30 — flipping wants and savings. Temporary sacrifice for long-term freedom.\n\n**High income:** If you earn well, consider 40/20/40 — reducing needs, keeping wants modest, and supercharging savings.\n\n## Start Calculating Your Budget\n\nFigure out exactly how your paycheck breaks down with our [salary calculator](/salary/) — it converts annual salary to monthly, biweekly, and hourly rates accounting for taxes.\n\nThen use our [percentage calculator](/percentage/) to run the 50/30/20 splits on your actual take-home pay.\n\n*This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

A precise age calculator accounts for all leap years between your birth date and today.","How old are you — really? Most people know their age in years, but can you say exactly how many months, weeks, or days you've been alive? And does it actually matter?\n\nIt turns out that knowing your precise age is more important than you might think — especially when it comes to legal rights, insurance, retirement planning, and medical milestones.\n\n## Why Exact Age Matters\n\nIn the United States, many rights and benefits are tied to specific ages, and sometimes even specific dates. For example, you can't sign up for Medicare the moment you turn 64 and 11 months — you need to wait until you're actually 65, and the enrollment window is tied to your birth month.\n\nSimilarly, withdrawing from your 401(k) before age 59½ triggers a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Not 59, not 60 — specifically 59 and a half. That half-year distinction can save you thousands of dollars.\n\n## Key US Age Milestones\n\n**Age 16:** Driver's license in most states. Some states allow learner's permits at 15 or 15½.\n\n**Age 18:** Legal adulthood. You can vote, join the military, sign contracts, and buy lottery tickets. You're also tried as an adult in criminal court.\n\n**Age 21:** Legal drinking age nationwide. Also the minimum age to purchase handguns from licensed dealers in most states.\n\n**Age 25:** Car insurance rates typically drop significantly. The brain's prefrontal cortex is considered fully developed.\n\n**Age 26:** Last year you can stay on a parent's health insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n**Age 50:** Eligible for catch-up contributions to 401(k) ($7,500 extra per year) and IRA ($1,000 extra per year).\n\n**Age 59½:** Can withdraw from 401(k) and traditional IRA without the 10% early withdrawal penalty.\n\n**Age 62:** Earliest age to claim Social Security retirement benefits (at a reduced rate).\n\n**Age 65:** Medicare eligibility begins. Enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period to avoid late penalties.\n\n**Age 67:** Full Social Security retirement age for anyone born after 1960.\n\n**Age 70:** Maximum Social Security benefit. Delaying past 67 increases your benefit by 8% per year up to age 70.\n\n## Fun Age Facts\n\nThe average American has been alive for about 28,000 days by age 77. You've experienced roughly 27 leap years by age 108. And if you were born on February 29, you've technically only had a \"real\" birthday every four years — though legally you still age normally.\n\nIn South Korea, everyone traditionally turns one year older on New Year's Day, meaning a baby born on December 31 would be considered two years old the very next day. South Korea officially switched to the international age system in 2023.\n\n## Calculate Your Exact Age\n\nWant to know your precise age down to the day? Our free [Age Calculator](/age) instantly calculates your exact age in years, months, and days.

Instead, eat between your BMR and TDEE to create a safe calorie deficit.",{"q":153,"a":154},"How accurate are BMR calculators?","Online BMR calculators using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation are accurate within about 10% for most people. For precise measurements, you'd need indirect calorimetry testing.","Mike started a diet by eating 1,200 calories a day because that's what a random website recommended. Two weeks later he was exhausted, irritable, and hadn't lost a single pound. The problem wasn't willpower — he was eating way below his BMR, and his body was fighting back.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between BMR and TDEE is the foundation of any smart nutrition plan, whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply eat better.\n\n## What Is BMR?\n\nBMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate. It's the number of calories your body burns just to stay alive — breathing, circulating blood, growing cells, and maintaining organ function. Think of it as the energy cost of simply existing.\n\nFor most adults, BMR accounts for 60–75% of total daily calories burned. A 30-year-old man who is 5'10\" and weighs 180 pounds has a BMR of roughly 1,800 calories. A 30-year-old woman who is 5'5\" and weighs 140 pounds has a BMR of about 1,400 calories.\n\nThe most widely used formula is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. For men, it's 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) – 5 × age – 5. For women, the same formula but subtract 161 instead of 5.\n\n## What Is TDEE?\n\nTDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It's your BMR plus all the additional calories you burn through daily activities, exercise, and even digesting food.\n\nTDEE is calculated by multiplying your BMR by an activity factor. If you're sedentary (desk job, little exercise), multiply by 1.2. Lightly active (exercise 1–3 days/week) is 1.375. Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days/week) is 1.55. Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week) is 1.725.\n\nUsing our example, the 180-pound man with a BMR of 1,800 who exercises 3–4 times per week has a TDEE of about 2,790 calories (1,800 × 1.55).\n\n## Why This Matters for Weight Loss\n\nHere's the key principle: to lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than your TDEE. To gain weight, eat more than your TDEE. To maintain, eat roughly at your TDEE.\n\nA safe calorie deficit is 500–750 calories below your TDEE per day, which produces about 1–1.5 pounds of weight loss per week. For our example man with a TDEE of 2,790, eating around 2,000–2,290 calories daily would produce steady, sustainable weight loss.\n\nThe critical mistake many people make is eating below their BMR. Going under 1,800 calories in this case can trigger metabolic adaptation — your body slows down, conserves energy, and actually makes weight loss harder.\n\n## How to Use These Numbers\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate your BMR using our [Calorie Calculator](/calorie) — it uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation automatically.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine your activity level honestly. Most people overestimate their activity. If you have a desk job and exercise 3 times a week, \"lightly active\" is probably more accurate than \"moderately active.\"\n\n**Step 3:** Set your calorie target. For weight loss, subtract 500 from your TDEE. For muscle gain, add 250–500. For maintenance, eat at your TDEE.\n\n**Step 4:** Track for two weeks and adjust. If you're not seeing results, your TDEE estimate might be off. Reduce by 100 calories and reassess.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n**Dramatic calorie cutting** rarely works long-term. A 1,000+ calorie deficit leads to muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, and eventual binge eating.\n\n**Ignoring protein** is another common error. When losing weight, aim for 0.7–1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to preserve muscle mass.\n\n**Not recalculating** as you lose weight. Your BMR and TDEE decrease as you get lighter, so what worked at 200 pounds won't work the same at 170.\n\n## Get Your Numbers\n\nUse our free [Calorie Calculator](/calorie) and [BMI Calculator](/bmi) to get your personalized BMR, TDEE, and healthy weight range in seconds.","src/content/posts/bmr-vs-tdee-explained.md","471a48794390c0df",{"html":159,"metadata":160},"\u003Cp>Mike started a diet by eating 1,200 calories a day because that’s what a random website recommended.

But Jake was a competitive CrossFit athlete with visible abs, while Ryan hadn't exercised in years. Same weight, completely different bodies. That's why body fat percentage matters more than the number on the scale.\n\n## What Is Body Fat Percentage?\n\nBody fat percentage is the proportion of your total body weight that comes from fat tissue. The rest is lean mass — muscle, bone, organs, water, and everything else.\n\n**Formula:** Body Fat % = (Fat Mass ÷ Total Body Weight) × 100\n\nA 180-pound man with 30 pounds of fat has a body fat percentage of 16.7%. The remaining 150 pounds is lean mass.\n\n## Body Fat Ranges by Category\n\n**Men:**\n\n| Category | Body Fat % |\n|:---|:---:|\n| Essential fat | 2-5% |\n| Athletes | 6-13% |\n| Fitness | 14-17% |\n| Average | 18-24% |\n| Overweight | 25%+ |\n\n**Women:**\n\n| Category | Body Fat % |\n|:---|:---:|\n| Essential fat | 10-13% |\n| Athletes | 14-20% |\n| Fitness | 21-24% |\n| Average | 25-31% |\n| Overweight | 32%+ |\n\nThese ranges shift slightly with age — it's natural and healthy to carry somewhat more fat as you get older.\n\n## How to Estimate Body Fat\n\nThere are several methods, ranging from free to expensive:\n\n**Navy Method (free, reasonably accurate):** Uses neck and waist measurements for men; neck, waist, and hip measurements for women. Our [body fat calculator](/body-fat/) uses this method — just grab a tape measure.\n\n**Skinfold calipers ($10-30):** A trained person pinches skin at multiple body sites and measures the fold thickness. Accuracy depends heavily on the person doing the measurement.\n\n**Bioelectrical impedance (BIA):** Found in smart scales and handheld devices. Convenient but accuracy varies with hydration levels. Best used to track trends over time rather than absolute numbers.\n\n**DEXA scan ($50-150):** The gold standard. Uses X-rays to measure bone, fat, and lean tissue precisely. Available at clinics and some gyms.\n\n## Why Body Fat Percentage Matters More Than Weight\n\nTwo people at 160 pounds can look completely different:\n\n**Person A:** 160 lbs, 15% body fat = 24 lbs of fat, 136 lbs of lean mass. Looks fit and toned.\n\n**Person B:** 160 lbs, 30% body fat = 48 lbs of fat, 112 lbs of lean mass. Looks soft, less defined.\n\nThe scale can't tell you which you are. Neither can BMI. Body fat percentage can.\n\nThis also explains why the scale sometimes goes up when you start exercising — you're gaining muscle (which is denser than fat) while losing fat. Your body composition improves even if your weight stays the same or increases slightly.\n\n## How to Lower Body Fat Percentage\n\nThe principles are straightforward:\n\n**Eat in a moderate calorie deficit** — 300-500 calories below your TDEE. Use our [calorie calculator](/calorie/) to find your number.\n\n**Prioritize protein** — 0.7-1g per pound of body weight helps preserve muscle while losing fat.\n\n**Strength train** — Lifting weights signals your body to keep muscle and burn fat. Cardio alone tends to reduce both.\n\n**Be patient** — Healthy fat loss is 0.5-1% body fat per month. Crash diets burn muscle along with fat, which wrecks your body composition.\n\n## Track Your Progress\n\nStart with our free [body fat calculator](/body-fat/) to get your baseline estimate.

Credit card debt compounds too — unpaid interest gets added to your balance, and you start paying interest on interest. That's why high-interest debt is so expensive.","Sarah opened a savings account at 22 with $5,000 and forgot about it. At 52 — thirty years later — she checked the balance and found over $38,000. She hadn't added a single dollar. The secret? Compound interest at 7% annual return, quietly multiplying her money year after year.\n\nThat's the power of compound interest. Let's break down exactly how it works.\n\n## What Is Compound Interest?\n\nCompound interest is interest calculated on both your initial deposit (the principal) and all the interest you've already earned. It's \"interest on interest\" — and it's the reason long-term investing works so well.\n\nHere's the formula:\n\n**A = P × (1 + r/n)^(n×t)**\n\nWhere:\n- **A** = Final amount\n- **P** = Principal (starting amount)\n- **r** = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)\n- **n** = Number of times compounded per year\n- **t** = Number of years\n\n## Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest\n\nThe difference becomes dramatic over time.\n\nLet's say you invest $10,000 at 8% for 20 years:\n\n**Simple interest:** $10,000 + ($10,000 × 0.08 × 20) = **$26,000**\n\n**Compound interest (annual):** $10,000 × (1.08)^20 = **$46,610**\n\nThat's an extra $20,610 — and you didn't do anything differently. The compound interest earned almost twice as much because each year's interest earned its own interest.\n\n## The Rule of 72\n\nWant a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money? Divide 72 by your interest rate.\n\n**Years to double = 72 ÷ Interest Rate**\n\nExamples:\n- At 6% → 72 ÷ 6 = **12 years** to double\n- At 8% → 72 ÷ 8 = **9 years** to double\n- At 10% → 72 ÷ 10 = **7.2 years** to double\n- At 12% → 72 ÷ 12 = **6 years** to double\n\n## Why Starting Early Matters So Much\n\nThe biggest factor in compound interest isn't the rate — it's time.\n\nConsider two people who each invest $5,000 per year at 8% return:\n\n**Alex starts at age 25**, invests for 10 years (until 35), then stops. Total invested: $50,000.\n\n**Jordan starts at age 35**, invests for 30 years (until 65). Total invested: $150,000.\n\nAt age 65: Alex has approximately **$787,000**. Jordan has approximately **$611,000**.\n\nAlex invested three times less money but ended up with more — because those extra 10 years of compounding made all the difference.\n\n## How Compounding Frequency Affects Growth\n\nMore frequent compounding means slightly more growth. Here's $10,000 at 8% for 10 years with different compounding frequencies:\n\n- **Annually:** $21,589\n- **Quarterly:** $21,911\n- **Monthly:** $22,196\n- **Daily:** $22,253\n\nThe difference between annual and daily compounding is about $664 on a $10,000 investment over 10 years. It matters more with larger amounts and longer timeframes.\n\n## Compound Interest in Real Life\n\nCompound interest shows up in many places:\n\n**Savings accounts** — Your bank pays interest on your balance, including previously earned interest.\n\n**401(k) and IRA** — Investment returns compound over decades, which is why retirement accounts grow so dramatically.\n\n**Index funds** — The S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually. At that rate, $10,000 becomes $174,000 in 30 years.\n\n**Credit card debt** — This is compound interest working against you. A $5,000 balance at 24% APR, paying only minimums, can take 20+ years to pay off and cost you $8,000+ in interest.\n\n## How to Take Advantage of Compound Interest\n\nThe strategy is simple: start early, be consistent, and be patient.\n\nEven small amounts matter. Investing just $200 per month at 8% for 30 years turns into over $298,000 — from only $72,000 in contributions. The rest is compound interest.\n\n## Calculate Your Compound Interest\n\nWant to see how much your money could grow?

Is 180°C the right oven temperature for chicken? What does it mean when the weather app abroad says \"it feels like -5\"?\n\nIf you've ever traveled internationally or followed a recipe from another country, you've hit the Fahrenheit-Celsius wall. Here's how to break through it.\n\n## The Conversion Formulas\n\n**Fahrenheit to Celsius:** (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C. So 72°F: (72-32) × 5/9 = 40 × 0.556 = 22.2°C.\n\n**Celsius to Fahrenheit:** (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F. So 25°C: (25 × 1.8) + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77°F.\n\nThose formulas are precise but hard to do in your head. Use these shortcuts instead.\n\n## The Quick Estimation Trick\n\n**Celsius to Fahrenheit:** Double it and add 30. This gives you a surprisingly close estimate for everyday temperatures. 10°C → 50°F (exact: 50°F, perfect). 20°C → 70°F (exact: 68°F). 30°C → 90°F (exact: 86°F). 35°C → 100°F (exact: 95°F).\n\n**Fahrenheit to Celsius:** Subtract 30, then halve it. 70°F → 20°C (exact: 21.1°C). 90°F → 30°C (exact: 32.2°C). It gets less accurate at extremes, but for weather temperatures it works great.\n\n## Weather Reference Points\n\nHere's what common Celsius temperatures feel like in Fahrenheit terms:\n\n-10°C (14°F) is bitterly cold — heavy winter coat, gloves, hat mandatory. 0°C (32°F) is freezing — literally, water turns to ice. 10°C (50°F) is cool — light jacket weather. 20°C (68°F) is comfortable room temperature. 25°C (77°F) is warm and pleasant. 30°C (86°F) is hot — summer day. 35°C (95°F) is very hot — stay hydrated. 40°C (104°F) is dangerously hot — heat advisory territory.\n\n## Cooking Temperatures\n\nOven temperatures are where Fahrenheit-Celsius confusion causes the most practical problems.\n\n150°C = 300°F (low/slow cooking). 180°C = 350°F (standard baking — cookies, cakes). 200°C = 400°F (roasting vegetables, chicken). 220°C = 425°F (high-heat roasting, pizza). 230°C = 450°F (bread, high-heat searing).\n\nFor meat doneness: Rare beef is 125°F (52°C). Medium is 145°F (63°C). Well-done is 160°F (71°C). Chicken must reach 165°F (74°C) for food safety.\n\n## Medical Temperatures\n\nNormal body temperature: 98.6°F (37°C). Low-grade fever: 99-100.3°F (37.2-37.9°C). Fever: 100.4°F+ (38°C+). High fever requiring medical attention: 103°F+ (39.4°C+). Hypothermia: below 95°F (35°C).\n\nFor children, always consult a pediatrician for fevers over 100.4°F (38°C) in infants under 3 months.\n\n## Convert Instantly\n\nSkip the mental math and use our free [Temperature Converter](/temperature) for instant, precise conversions between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.","src/content/posts/fahrenheit-celsius-quick-guide.md","963b9d9a0341086c",{"html":391,"metadata":392},"\u003Cp>Is 25°C warm enough for shorts?

Body fat percentage directly measures how much of your weight is fat versus lean tissue, making it a more accurate health indicator.",{"q":434,"a":435},"Can you have too little body fat?","Yes. Essential body fat is about 2-5% for men and 10-13% for women. Going below these levels is dangerous and can cause hormonal disruption, organ damage, immune system failure, and for women, loss of menstrual cycles.",{"q":207,"a":437},"Women's bodies require higher essential fat for reproductive health, hormone production, and breast tissue. This biological difference means a healthy woman at 25% body fat and a healthy man at 15% body fat are at equivalent fitness levels.",{"q":439,"a":440},"What is the most accurate way to measure body fat?","DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scans are the gold standard, accurate to within 1-2%. Hydrostatic weighing is also very accurate. Calipers are reasonably accurate with a skilled tester. Bathroom smart scales using bioelectrical impedance are convenient but can vary by 3-5%.","Step on a scale and you get one number. But that number doesn't tell you whether your 180 pounds is mostly muscle or mostly fat. Two people can weigh exactly the same but look completely different and have vastly different health risks.\n\nThat's why body fat percentage matters more than weight alone.\n\n## What Is Body Fat Percentage?\n\nBody fat percentage is the proportion of your total weight that consists of fat. If you weigh 180 pounds and have 20% body fat, you're carrying 36 pounds of fat and 144 pounds of lean mass (muscle, bone, water, organs).\n\nYour body has two types of fat. Essential fat is the minimum needed for basic health — it cushions organs, insulates nerves, and enables hormone production. Storage fat is the extra energy your body has saved, stored beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat) and around organs (visceral fat).\n\n## Healthy Ranges by Gender\n\n**Men** have lower essential fat requirements. Healthy body fat ranges for men are: Athletes 6-13%, Fitness 14-17%, Acceptable 18-24%, Obese 25%+.\n\n**Women** carry more essential fat for reproductive and hormonal health. Healthy ranges for women are: Athletes 14-20%, Fitness 21-24%, Acceptable 25-31%, Obese 32%+.\n\n## How Age Affects Body Fat\n\nBody fat naturally increases with age as muscle mass declines. A healthy 25-year-old man at 15% body fat and a healthy 55-year-old man at 22% body fat are both within normal ranges.\n\nFor men in their 20s, 10-20% is healthy. In their 30s-40s, 12-22%. In their 50s-60s, 15-25%.\n\nFor women in their 20s, 18-28% is healthy. In their 30s-40s, 20-30%. In their 50s-60s, 22-33%.\n\n## Why Visceral Fat Is the Danger\n\nNot all body fat is created equal. Subcutaneous fat (under the skin) is relatively benign. Visceral fat (around organs in the abdominal cavity) is the dangerous type — it's metabolically active and linked to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and certain cancers.\n\nYou can be \"skinny fat\" — normal weight with low muscle mass and high visceral fat — and face serious health risks that BMI alone won't reveal.\n\nWaist circumference is a quick proxy for visceral fat. For men, a waist over 40 inches (102 cm) signals elevated risk. For women, over 35 inches (89 cm).\n\n## How to Reduce Body Fat\n\n**Strength training** is the most effective long-term strategy. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, so building muscle raises your metabolic rate.\n\n**Protein intake** should be 0.7-1 gram per pound of body weight. Protein preserves muscle during fat loss and keeps you feeling full longer.\n\n**Moderate calorie deficit** of 500 calories below your TDEE produces about 1 pound of fat loss per week. Larger deficits risk muscle loss. Learn more about TDEE in our [BMR vs. TDEE guide](/blog/bmr-vs-tdee-explained).\n\n**Sleep** matters more than most people realize. Poor sleep increases cortisol and ghrelin (hunger hormone), making fat loss harder. Aim for 7-9 hours.\n\n## Measure and Track\n\nUse our free [Body Fat Calculator](/body-fat) to estimate your body fat percentage using the US Navy method.

Counting from January 28 to March 5 means crossing through February — which could be 28 or 29 days depending on the year.\n\nThis irregularity is why so many people get date calculations wrong, and why calculators are genuinely helpful here.\n\n## Common Date Calculations\n\n**Days until an event.** Planning a wedding for September 20? You need to know exactly how many days you have left to prepare. From today (February 2026), that's roughly 225 days — or about 32 weeks.\n\n**Pregnancy due dates.** The standard pregnancy is 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of the last menstrual period. Knowing the exact day count helps track trimester transitions and schedule appointments.\n\n**Lease and contract terms.** A 12-month lease signed on March 15 doesn't expire on March 15 of the next year — it typically expires on March 14. Understanding whether terms are calculated by calendar months or by days matters for legal purposes.\n\n**Project timelines.** Agile sprints, construction schedules, and academic semesters all depend on accurate day counts. Missing a deadline by one day because you forgot February was short is an avoidable mistake.\n\n**Age verification.** As we discussed in our [age milestones guide](/blog/age-milestones-guide), precise day counting matters for legal thresholds like turning 21 or becoming eligible for Medicare.\n\n## Business Days vs. Calendar Days\n\nA common source of confusion is the difference between calendar days and business days.\n\nCalendar days include every day — weekends and holidays included.

Meanwhile, her friend Marcus had a 4.2 GPA. How is that even possible on a 4.0 scale? Understanding how GPA actually works — and what colleges really care about — can save you a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\n## The 4.0 Scale\n\nThe standard unweighted GPA scale converts letter grades to numbers. An A equals 4.0, A- equals 3.7, B+ equals 3.3, B equals 3.0, B- equals 2.7, C+ equals 2.3, C equals 2.0, C- equals 1.7, D equals 1.0, and F equals 0.\n\nTo calculate your GPA, multiply each grade's point value by the course's credit hours, add everything up, then divide by total credit hours.\n\nFor example, if you earned an A (4.0) in a 4-credit course and a B (3.0) in a 3-credit course, your GPA would be: (4.0 × 4 + 3.0 × 3) ÷ 7 = 25 ÷ 7 = 3.57.\n\n## Weighted vs. Unweighted\n\nWeighted GPA rewards students for taking harder classes. Honors courses typically add 0.5 points and AP/IB courses add 1.0 point to each grade.\n\nSo a B in a regular class is 3.0, a B in honors is 3.5, and a B in AP is 4.0. An A in AP is 5.0 — which is how students can have GPAs above 4.0.\n\nThis means Marcus's 4.2 weighted GPA might actually reflect the same caliber of work as Jessica's 3.4, just with more AP classes on his schedule.\n\n## What GPA Do You Need?\n\n**Community colleges:** Generally accept all students regardless of GPA. A 2.0+ is standard.\n\n**State universities:** Most require a 2.5-3.0 minimum, with competitive programs wanting 3.3+.\n\n**Selective private colleges:** Typically expect 3.5+ unweighted, with many admitted students having 3.7-4.0.\n\n**Ivy League and elite schools:** Average admitted GPA is 3.9+ unweighted, though they consider the rigor of your course load heavily.\n\n**Graduate school:** Most programs require a 3.0 minimum, with competitive programs expecting 3.5+.\n\n**Scholarships:** Many academic scholarships require a 3.0+ minimum, with the most generous awards going to 3.7+ students.\n\n## How to Improve Your GPA\n\n**Prioritize high-credit courses.** An A in a 4-credit class impacts your GPA twice as much as an A in a 2-credit class.\n\n**Use grade replacement.** Many schools allow you to retake a course and replace the old grade. If you got a D in Chemistry, retaking for an A makes a huge difference.\n\n**Don't neglect \"easy\" classes.** An A in an elective counts just as much as an A in your major for your cumulative GPA.\n\n**Seek help early.** If you're struggling in a class, visit office hours in week 3, not week 14.

But by the end of the loan, you'll have paid $23,199 — over $3,000 more than you borrowed.\n\nThat extra $3,199 is the true cost of borrowing, and most people never think about it when signing loan papers. Understanding how interest works puts you in control.\n\n## How Interest Is Calculated\n\nMost loans use simple interest on the remaining balance. Each month, the bank calculates: Monthly Interest = Remaining Balance × (Annual Rate ÷ 12).\n\nOn a $20,000 loan at 6%: first month's interest is $20,000 × (0.06 ÷ 12) = $100. Your $387 payment covers that $100 in interest, and the remaining $287 reduces your principal to $19,713.\n\nNext month, interest is calculated on $19,713 instead of $20,000: $19,713 × 0.005 = $98.57. So $288.43 goes to principal. Each month, more money goes to principal and less to interest.\n\n## The Amortization Schedule\n\nThis gradual shift from interest-heavy to principal-heavy payments is called amortization. On a 30-year mortgage, the shift is dramatic.\n\nOn a $300,000 mortgage at 7%, your first payment of $1,996 breaks down as $1,750 in interest and only $246 in principal. After 15 years of payments (halfway through the loan), you've paid about $359,000 but still owe $234,000 — you've only reduced your balance by $66,000.\n\nThis is why early extra payments are so powerful. An extra $200/month in the first year saves far more total interest than $200/month in year 25.\n\n## APR vs. Interest Rate\n\nThe interest rate is the base cost. APR includes origination fees, closing costs, discount points, and other charges, spread over the loan's life.\n\nA mortgage might have a 6.5% interest rate but a 6.8% APR after fees. A personal loan might advertise 8% interest but have a 12% APR after the 3% origination fee.\n\nAlways compare loans using APR, not the advertised interest rate. It's the only honest apples-to-apples comparison.\n\n## Fixed vs. Variable Rates\n\n**Fixed rate** stays the same for the entire loan term. Your payment is predictable, which makes budgeting easy. Best when interest rates are low or you want certainty.\n\n**Variable rate** (adjustable rate) starts lower but can change based on market conditions. An ARM mortgage might start at 5.5% but could rise to 8%+ after the initial fixed period.\n\nVariable rates are riskier but can save money if rates drop or if you plan to pay off the loan quickly.\n\n## Strategies to Pay Less Interest\n\n**Make biweekly payments.** Instead of 12 monthly payments, make 26 half-payments per year. This sneaks in one extra full payment annually, which on a 30-year mortgage can save 4-6 years and tens of thousands in interest.\n\n**Round up payments.** If your payment is $387, pay $400. That extra $13/month on a $20,000 car loan saves about $200 in interest and pays off the loan 3 months early.\n\n**Refinance when rates drop.** If rates fall 0.75-1% below your current rate, refinancing often makes sense. Run the numbers to ensure savings exceed closing costs.\n\n**Attack highest-rate debt first.** If you have multiple loans, the \"avalanche method\" — paying extra toward the highest interest rate loan — minimizes total interest paid.\n\n## Run the Numbers\n\nUse our free [Loan Calculator](/loan) to see exactly how much interest you'll pay over any loan term, and experiment with extra payments to see how much you can save.

But being debt-free also has psychological value.","You just signed a 30-year mortgage for $300,000 at 7% interest. Your monthly payment is $1,996. Over 30 years, you'll pay a total of $718,527 — more than double the original loan amount. Wait, what?\n\nIt sounds shocking, but that's exactly how amortization works. Understanding it is the key to making smarter borrowing decisions.\n\n## What Is Amortization?\n\nAmortization is the process of paying off a loan through regular, equal payments over a set period. Each payment is split between two things: interest (what the bank charges you for borrowing) and principal (reducing what you actually owe).\n\nThe twist is that the split changes over time. Early payments are mostly interest. Later payments are mostly principal.\n\n## Why Early Payments Are Mostly Interest\n\nInterest is calculated on your remaining balance. When you start a loan, your balance is at its maximum — so the interest charge is at its maximum too.\n\n**Example — Month 1 of a $300,000 loan at 7%:**\n- Monthly interest rate: 7% ÷ 12 = 0.583%\n- Interest charge: $300,000 × 0.00583 = **$1,750**\n- Your payment: $1,996\n- Amount going to principal: $1,996 - $1,750 = **$246**\n\nIn the first month, 87.7% of your payment goes to interest. Only 12.3% reduces your debt.\n\n**Fast forward to Month 300 (year 25):**\n- Remaining balance: about $107,000\n- Interest charge: $107,000 × 0.00583 = **$624**\n- Amount going to principal: $1,996 - $624 = **$1,372**\n\nNow 68.7% goes to principal. The balance shrinks faster and faster as you progress.\n\n## The Total Cost of Borrowing\n\nThe interest rate determines how much extra you pay over the life of the loan.\n\nFor a **$300,000 mortgage:**\n\n| Term | Rate | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 30 years | 6% | $1,799 | $347,515 |\n| 30 years | 7% | $1,996 | $418,527 |\n| 30 years | 8% | $2,201 | $492,476 |\n| 15 years | 6% | $2,532 | $155,683 |\n| 15 years | 7% | $2,696 | $185,367 |\n\nA single percentage point difference on a 30-year mortgage costs roughly $70,000 in extra interest.\n\n## How Extra Payments Save You Thousands\n\nMaking extra payments — even small ones — directly reduces your principal, which means less interest accrues in every future month. The effect snowballs.\n\n**$300,000 mortgage at 7%, 30 years:**\n- Normal payoff: 30 years, $418,527 in interest\n- Extra $100/month: Paid off in 25.5 years, saves **$56,000** in interest\n- Extra $200/month: Paid off in 22.5 years, saves **$98,000** in interest\n- Extra $500/month: Paid off in 17.5 years, saves **$175,000** in interest\n\nEven rounding up your payment to the nearest hundred can shave years off your loan.\n\n## Amortization Applies to All Loans\n\nThe same principle works for car loans, student loans, and personal loans — any loan with fixed payments.\n\n**Auto loan example:** A $35,000 car loan at 6.5% for 5 years has a monthly payment of $685. Total interest paid: $6,100. If you extend to 7 years, the payment drops to $520 but total interest rises to $8,700.\n\n**Student loans:** Federal student loans typically have 10-year repayment terms. Extending to 25 years lowers payments but dramatically increases total interest.\n\n## Calculate Your Loan Payments\n\nUse our free [loan calculator](/loan/) to see your monthly payment, total interest, and a full amortization schedule. Try different loan amounts, rates, and terms to find the best option.\n\nFor home buyers, pair it with our [compound interest calculator](/compound-interest/) to compare what investing the same money could earn.\n\n*This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

But was it really a deal, or was the \"original price\" inflated to make the discount look bigger?\n\nKnowing how to calculate discounts is a superpower that saves real money. Here's how to never fall for fake deals again.\n\n## The Basic Discount Formula\n\nTo find the sale price, use this simple formula: Sale Price = Original Price × (1 - Discount Rate).\n\nFor a $120 jacket at 25% off: $120 × (1 - 0.25) = $120 × 0.75 = $90.\n\nA shortcut that makes mental math easier: for 10% off, just move the decimal point one place left. 10% of $120 is $12. For 20%, double that: $24. For 25%, find 25% as a quarter: $120 ÷ 4 = $30 off.\n\n## Stacking Discounts\n\nWhen you have multiple discounts — like a 30% sale plus a 15% coupon — they don't simply add up to 45%.\n\nInstead, apply them sequentially. Start with $100 at 30% off = $70. Then 15% off $70 = $59.50. Your actual total discount is 40.5%, not 45%.\n\nOrder doesn't matter mathematically (30% then 15% gives the same result as 15% then 30%), but some retailers apply store discounts before coupons, which can affect how loyalty points or cash-back is calculated.\n\n## Spotting Fake Deals\n\n**Inflated \"original\" prices.** Some retailers raise prices before a sale, then \"discount\" them back to normal. Check price history tools like CamelCamelCamel for Amazon or Honey for other retailers.\n\n**\"Up to X% off\" language.** This means the maximum discount on a few items. Average discounts are usually much lower.\n\n**BOGO math.** \"Buy one get one 50% off\" sounds great, but you're only saving 25% total. For two $40 items: $40 + $20 = $60, versus $80 at full price. That's a 25% discount, not 50%.\n\n**Bundle \"savings.\"** Compare the bundle price to buying items individually. Sometimes the \"bundle deal\" is the same or even more expensive than purchasing separately.\n\n## Unit Price: The True Comparison Tool\n\nThe unit price (price per ounce, per count, per ml) is the only honest way to compare products of different sizes.\n\nA 12-pack of paper towels for $15.99 ($1.33 per roll) vs. a 6-pack for $7.49 ($1.25 per roll) — the smaller pack is actually cheaper per roll.\n\nMost US grocery stores show unit prices on shelf labels, but not all retailers do. When they don't, divide the total price by the quantity yourself.\n\n## The 10-Second Mental Math Tricks\n\n**10% off:** Move decimal left. $85 → $8.50 off → $76.50.\n\n**20% off:** Find 10%, double it. $85 → $8.50 × 2 = $17 off → $68.\n\n**25% off:** Divide by 4. $84 ÷ 4 = $21 off → $63.\n\n**33% off:** Divide by 3. $90 ÷ 3 = $30 off → $60.\n\n**50% off:** Divide by 2. This one's easy.\n\n## Calculate Any Discount\n\nOur free [Discount Calculator](/discount) and [Unit Price Calculator](/unit-price) do all this math instantly.

You leave feeling confused — you exercise regularly and feel healthy. What does this number actually mean?\n\nBMI is one of the most widely used health metrics in the world. It's also one of the most misunderstood. Here's what you need to know.\n\n## What Is BMI?\n\nBMI stands for Body Mass Index. It's a simple calculation that uses your height and weight to estimate whether you're at a healthy weight.\n\n**BMI Formula (metric):** BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²\n\n**BMI Formula (imperial):** BMI = (Weight in pounds × 703) ÷ (Height in inches)²\n\n**Example:** A person who is 5'9\" (69 inches) and weighs 170 lbs:\n- (170 × 703) ÷ (69)² = 119,510 ÷ 4,761 = **25.1**\n\n## BMI Categories\n\nThe World Health Organization classifies BMI into these ranges:\n\n- **Under 18.5** — Underweight\n- **18.5 to 24.9** — Normal weight\n- **25.0 to 29.9** — Overweight\n- **30.0 to 34.9** — Obese (Class 1)\n- **35.0 to 39.9** — Obese (Class 2)\n- **40.0 and above** — Obese (Class 3)\n\nThese ranges were developed based on large population studies linking BMI to health risks like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.\n\n## What BMI Gets Right\n\nBMI works well as a quick population-level screening tool. For most people who aren't athletes or bodybuilders, a higher BMI does correlate with increased health risks.\n\nIt's cheap, easy, and requires no special equipment — just a scale and a measuring tape. That's why doctors use it as a starting point during checkups.\n\n## Where BMI Falls Short\n\nBMI has some significant blind spots.\n\n**It can't tell muscle from fat.** A 6'0\" football player weighing 220 lbs of mostly muscle has a BMI of 29.8 — technically \"overweight.\" Meanwhile, someone with very little muscle mass could have a \"normal\" BMI but carry excess body fat.\n\n**It doesn't account for body composition.** Two people can have the same BMI but very different body fat percentages, fitness levels, and health outcomes.\n\n**It doesn't consider age, sex, or ethnicity.** Health risks associated with the same BMI differ across demographic groups. Some researchers have proposed adjusted BMI ranges for different populations.\n\n**It ignores fat distribution.** Belly fat (visceral fat) is much more dangerous than fat stored in hips and thighs. BMI can't tell the difference.\n\n## Better Metrics to Track Alongside BMI\n\nFor a fuller picture of health, consider these measurements:\n\n**Waist circumference** — A waist over 40 inches (men) or 35 inches (women) signals higher risk, regardless of BMI.\n\n**Body fat percentage** — Our [body fat calculator](/body-fat/) gives a more accurate picture than BMI alone. Healthy ranges are roughly 10-20% for men and 18-28% for women.\n\n**Waist-to-hip ratio** — Dividing your waist measurement by your hip measurement. A ratio above 0.90 (men) or 0.85 (women) indicates higher health risk.\n\n## How to Use BMI Wisely\n\nThink of BMI as one data point — not a verdict. If your BMI is in the normal range and you feel good, great. If it's outside that range, it's worth having a deeper conversation with your doctor about your overall health picture.\n\nThe most important thing isn't a number on a chart. It's whether you're eating well, moving regularly, sleeping enough, and managing stress.\n\n## Check Your Numbers\n\nCalculate your BMI instantly with our free [BMI calculator](/bmi/). You can also check your [calorie needs](/calorie/) and [body fat percentage](/body-fat/) for a more complete health snapshot.\n\n*This content is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.*","src/content/posts/how-to-calculate-bmi.md","8f998e89f427b9f7",{"html":786,"metadata":787},"\u003Cp>You step on the scale at your annual checkup.

How is that possible? Understanding discount math protects your wallet from misleading sales tactics.\n\n## Basic Discount Calculation\n\nThe simplest discount calculation:\n\n**Sale Price = Original Price × (1 - Discount Rate)**\n\nOr if you prefer: **Sale Price = Original Price - (Original Price × Discount %)**\n\n**Example:** A $95 jacket at 40% off:\n- $95 × (1 - 0.40) = $95 × 0.60 = **$57**\n- You save: $95 - $57 = $38\n\n**Quick shortcut:** To find the price after discount, just multiply by the \"keep\" percentage:\n- 20% off → multiply by 0.80\n- 25% off → multiply by 0.75\n- 30% off → multiply by 0.70\n- 40% off → multiply by 0.60\n- 50% off → multiply by 0.50\n\n## Stacked Discounts (The Tricky Part)\n\n\"Take an extra 20% off already reduced items!\" Sounds amazing, but the math isn't what most people think.\n\n**The wrong way:** 40% off + 20% off = 60% off ❌\n\n**The right way:** Apply each discount sequentially.\n\n**Example:** $100 item, 40% off then extra 20% off:\n1. First discount: $100 × 0.60 = $60\n2. Second discount: $60 × 0.80 = **$48**\n3. Actual total discount: ($100 - $48) ÷ $100 = **52% off**\n\nThat's 52% off, not 60%. The difference adds up when you're spending hundreds of dollars.\n\n**Quick formula for stacked discounts:**\nTotal discount = 1 - (first multiplier × second multiplier)\n= 1 - (0.60 × 0.80) = 1 - 0.48 = 52%\n\n## Finding the Original Discount Percentage\n\nSometimes you see a sale tag but want to know the actual percentage off:\n\n**Discount % = ((Original - Sale Price) ÷ Original) × 100**\n\n**Example:** Was $249, now $179:\n- ($249 - $179) ÷ $249 × 100 = **28.1% off**\n\nThis is useful when stores just show the sale price without stating the percentage.\n\n## Sales Tax After Discount\n\nRemember: sales tax is calculated on the discounted price, not the original price. That's one small benefit of buying on sale.\n\n**Example:** $80 item at 25% off in a state with 8% sales tax:\n- Discounted price: $80 × 0.75 = $60\n- Tax: $60 × 0.08 = $4.80\n- **Total: $64.80**\n\n## \"Buy One Get One\" Deals Decoded\n\nBOGO deals aren't always 50% off:\n- **BOGO Free** — Buy 1, get 1 free = 50% off if you buy exactly 2\n- **BOGO 50% off** — Buy 1, get 1 at half price = 25% off per item\n- **Buy 2 Get 1 Free** — 33% off per item (if you buy exactly 3)\n\nThe real question is whether you actually need the extra items. A \"deal\" on something you don't need isn't a deal — it's spending.\n\n## Calculate Any Discount Instantly\n\nSkip the mental math.

What about the bartender who made your cocktails?\n\nTipping in America can feel complicated — especially if you didn't grow up with it. This guide makes it simple.\n\n## Restaurant Tipping\n\nSit-down restaurants are where tipping matters most. Servers in many US states earn a base wage of just $2.13 per hour, with tips making up the majority of their income.\n\n**Standard guidelines:**\n- **15%** — Acceptable for adequate service\n- **18-20%** — Standard for good service (this is the new baseline for most people)\n- **20-25%** — Great service, complex orders, large parties\n- **25%+** — Exceptional experience\n\n**Large parties:** Many restaurants add an automatic 18-20% gratuity for groups of 6 or more. Check your bill before adding an additional tip.\n\n**Buffets:** 10-15% is standard, since servers still bring drinks and clear plates.\n\n## Quick Mental Math for Restaurant Tips\n\nDon't want to pull out your phone? Try these shortcuts:\n\n**For 20%:** Move the decimal point one place left (that's 10%), then double it. A $65 bill → $6.50 → doubled = $13 tip.\n\n**For 15%:** Find 10%, then add half. $65 → $6.50 + $3.25 = $9.75 tip.\n\n**For 18%:** Find 20% and subtract a little. $65 → $13 - $1.30 = about $11.70.\n\nOr just use our [tip calculator](/tip/) and skip the math entirely.\n\n## Tipping Guide by Service\n\nBeyond restaurants, here's what's expected across different services in the US:\n\n**Food & Drink:**\n- Coffee shop / counter service: $1-2 per order or 10-15%\n- Food delivery: 15-20% or $3-5 minimum\n- Bartender: $1-2 per drink, or 15-20% of tab\n- Takeout: 0-10% (optional, but increasingly common)\n\n**Personal Services:**\n- Hairstylist / barber: 15-20%\n- Spa / massage: 15-20%\n- Nail salon: 15-20%\n- Tattoo artist: 15-25%\n\n**Travel & Hospitality:**\n- Hotel housekeeper: $2-5 per night\n- Bellhop: $1-2 per bag\n- Concierge: $5-20 depending on service\n- Valet parking: $2-5 when your car is returned\n- Taxi / rideshare: 15-20%\n\n**Home Services:**\n- Movers: $20-50 per person or 15-20% of total\n- Furniture delivery: $5-20 per person\n- Grocery delivery: 15-20% or $5 minimum\n\n## When You Don't Need to Tip\n\nTipping isn't expected everywhere:\n\n- Fast food restaurants (with no table service)\n- Retail stores\n- Medical offices\n- Government employees\n- Business owners who set their own prices (though it's still appreciated)\n\n## The Pre-Tax vs. Post-Tax Debate\n\nThe traditional etiquette is to tip on the **pre-tax subtotal** — since the tax goes to the government, not the server. However, many people find it easier to tip on the full amount, and the difference is usually small.\n\nOn an $80 pre-tax bill with 8% sales tax ($86.40 total), the difference between 20% on pre-tax ($16) and post-tax ($17.28) is just $1.28. Tip on whichever feels right to you.\n\n## Calculate Your Tip Instantly\n\nOur free [tip calculator](/tip/) lets you split the bill, adjust the percentage, and calculate per-person amounts in seconds.

She was hungry all the time, couldn't focus at work, and quit after two weeks. The problem wasn't willpower — she was eating far less than her body actually needed.\n\nKnowing your calorie needs isn't about obsessive counting. It's about understanding the basic math of energy so you can make informed choices.\n\n## What Is a Calorie?\n\nA calorie is a unit of energy. Your body needs energy to do everything — breathe, think, walk, digest food, even sleep. The food you eat provides that energy, measured in calories.\n\nEvery person needs a different number of calories based on their body size, age, sex, and how active they are.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Your BMR\n\nBMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the number of calories your body burns just to stay alive — heartbeat, breathing, brain function, cell repair. Even if you stayed in bed all day, you'd burn this many calories.\n\n**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (most accurate):**\n\n- Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5\n- Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161\n\n**Example — 30-year-old woman, 5'5\" (165 cm), 145 lbs (66 kg):**\n- BMR = (10 × 66) + (6.25 × 165) - (5 × 30) - 161\n- BMR = 660 + 1,031 - 150 - 161 = **1,380 calories/day**\n\nThat means her body burns 1,380 calories just to function — before any movement or exercise.\n\n## Step 2: Factor In Activity Level (TDEE)\n\nYour Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is your BMR multiplied by an activity factor:\n\n| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |\n|:---|:---:|:---|\n| Sedentary | 1.2 | Desk job, little exercise |\n| Lightly active | 1.375 | Light exercise 1-3 days/week |\n| Moderately active | 1.55 | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week |\n| Very active | 1.725 | Hard exercise 6-7 days/week |\n| Extremely active | 1.9 | Athlete or very physical job |\n\n**For our example (moderately active):**\n- TDEE = 1,380 × 1.55 = **2,139 calories/day**\n\nThis is her maintenance level — eating this amount keeps her weight stable.\n\n## Calorie Goals Based on Your Objective\n\n**To lose weight:** Eat 300-500 calories below your TDEE. A 500-calorie deficit leads to roughly 1 pound of fat loss per week.\n\n**To maintain weight:** Eat at your TDEE.\n\n**To gain muscle:** Eat 200-400 calories above your TDEE, combined with strength training.\n\n**For our example:**\n- Weight loss: 2,139 - 500 = **1,639 calories/day**\n- Maintenance: **2,139 calories/day**\n- Muscle gain: 2,139 + 300 = **2,439 calories/day**\n\nNotice that 1,639 is still well above the 1,200 that Emily was struggling with. Extreme restriction isn't necessary — and usually backfires.\n\n## Why Extreme Calorie Cutting Backfires\n\nWhen you eat too little, your body responds by:\n\n**Slowing your metabolism** — Your BMR drops as your body tries to conserve energy.\n\n**Increasing hunger hormones** — Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) spikes, making cravings intense.\n\n**Burning muscle** — Without adequate protein and calories, your body breaks down muscle tissue for energy.\n\n**Reducing energy** — You feel tired, foggy, and irritable.\n\nThe minimum recommended intake is generally 1,200 calories for women and 1,500 for men — and even those numbers feel restrictive for most people. A moderate deficit of 300-500 below TDEE is more sustainable and preserves muscle mass.\n\n## Quality Matters as Much as Quantity\n\nTwo people eating 2,000 calories a day can have very different health outcomes depending on what they eat. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that keep you full:\n\n**High satiety:** Lean protein, vegetables, whole grains, beans, fruits, nuts (in moderation).\n\n**Low satiety:** Sugary drinks, candy, chips, ultra-processed snacks — they go down easy but don't keep you satisfied.\n\nA practical approach is to build meals around protein and vegetables first, then add carbs and fats to fill out your calorie target.\n\n## Calculate Your Daily Calorie Needs\n\nGet your personalized number with our free [calorie calculator](/calorie/) — enter your stats and activity level to see your BMR, TDEE, and calorie targets for weight loss or gain.

You have a pile of transcripts and grade reports, but no idea how to actually calculate the number. Sound familiar?\n\nGPA calculation isn't complicated once you understand the system. Here's everything you need to know.\n\n## What Is GPA?\n\nGPA stands for Grade Point Average. In the US, it's measured on a 4.0 scale and represents the average of your grades weighted by credit hours.\n\n**Standard 4.0 Scale:**\n\n| Letter Grade | Grade Points |\n|:---:|:---:|\n| A / A+ | 4.0 |\n| A- | 3.7 |\n| B+ | 3.3 |\n| B | 3.0 |\n| B- | 2.7 |\n| C+ | 2.3 |\n| C | 2.0 |\n| C- | 1.7 |\n| D+ | 1.3 |\n| D | 1.0 |\n| F | 0.0 |\n\n## How to Calculate GPA: Step by Step\n\nHere's the process in four steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Convert each letter grade to its grade point value.\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply each grade point by the number of credit hours for that course.\n\n**Step 3:** Add up all the quality points (grade points × credits).\n\n**Step 4:** Divide total quality points by total credit hours.\n\n**Example Semester:**\n\n| Course | Grade | Points | Credits | Quality Points |\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| English 101 | A | 4.0 | 3 | 12.0 |\n| Calculus | B+ | 3.3 | 4 | 13.2 |\n| Biology | B | 3.0 | 4 | 12.0 |\n| History | A- | 3.7 | 3 | 11.1 |\n| Art | A | 4.0 | 2 | 8.0 |\n\n**Total quality points:** 56.3\n**Total credits:** 16\n**Semester GPA:** 56.3 ÷ 16 = **3.52**\n\n## Cumulative GPA vs. Semester GPA\n\nYour **semester GPA** covers just one term. Your **cumulative GPA** averages all semesters together, weighted by credits.\n\nTo calculate cumulative GPA, add up all quality points from all semesters and divide by all credit hours attempted.\n\n## What's a Good GPA?\n\nIt depends on your goals, but here's a general framework:\n\n- **3.7 - 4.0** — Excellent. Dean's list, summa cum laude territory.\n- **3.5 - 3.69** — Very good. Magna cum laude range.\n- **3.0 - 3.49** — Good. Meets most grad school minimums.\n- **2.5 - 2.99** — Average. May limit some opportunities.\n- **Below 2.0** — Academic probation at most schools.\n\n## How to Raise Your GPA\n\nThe math is straightforward: you need enough high grades to pull the average up.\n\n**The credit hour factor:** A student with 30 total credits can raise their GPA faster than a student with 100 credits, because each new grade has more relative weight.\n\n**Strategic course selection:** Some students take easier electives to boost GPA, while also taking challenging courses in their major. It's a balancing act.\n\n**Retake policies:** Many schools let you retake a course and replace the old grade. If you got a D in a 4-credit class, retaking it for an A replaces 4 quality points with 16 — a massive swing.\n\n## Calculate Your GPA Instantly\n\nSkip the manual math.

If you've ever stared at a listing price wondering what your actual monthly payment would be, you're not alone.\n\nUnderstanding mortgage calculations doesn't require a finance degree — just a few key concepts and a good calculator.\n\n## What Makes Up a Mortgage Payment\n\nYour monthly mortgage payment has four components, known as PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance.\n\n**Principal** is the portion that actually pays down your loan balance. In the early years of a mortgage, this is surprisingly small — most of your payment goes toward interest.\n\n**Interest** is what the bank charges you for borrowing money. On a $300,000 loan at 7%, you'd pay roughly $21,000 in interest during just the first year.\n\n**Property taxes** vary by location but typically run between 0.5% and 2.5% of your home's value annually. A $350,000 home in Texas might have $8,750 in annual property taxes, while the same home in Hawaii might only owe $1,225.\n\n**Homeowners insurance** protects your property and usually costs $1,000 to $3,000 per year depending on coverage and location.\n\n## The Mortgage Payment Formula\n\nThe core formula for calculating monthly principal and interest is:\n\n**M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n – 1]**\n\nWhere M is your monthly payment, P is the loan principal, r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12), and n is the total number of payments.\n\nFor a $280,000 loan (after a 20% down payment on $350,000) at 7% interest over 30 years: the monthly principal and interest payment comes to approximately $1,863.\n\nAdd roughly $400 for taxes and $150 for insurance, and the total monthly payment is around $2,413.\n\n## How Down Payment Affects Your Payment\n\nThe down payment directly reduces your loan amount and can eliminate private mortgage insurance (PMI). Here's how different down payments affect a $350,000 home at 7% interest:\n\nA 5% down payment ($17,500) means borrowing $332,500, resulting in roughly $2,212 monthly for principal and interest, plus PMI of about $140/month.\n\nA 10% down payment ($35,000) reduces the loan to $315,000, dropping the payment to about $2,096 plus PMI of around $105/month.\n\nA 20% down payment ($70,000) brings the loan to $280,000 and a payment of $1,863 — with no PMI required.\n\n## 15-Year vs. 30-Year Comparison\n\nA shorter loan term means higher monthly payments but dramatically less total interest. On a $280,000 loan at 7%:\n\nThe 30-year option gives you a $1,863 monthly payment but you'll pay $390,680 in total interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe 15-year option bumps the payment to $2,517 monthly, but total interest drops to $173,060 — saving you over $217,000.\n\n## Smart Strategies for Lower Payments\n\n**Improve your credit score** before applying. Going from a 670 to a 740 score could save you 0.5% on your rate, which on a $280,000 loan saves roughly $100/month.\n\n**Shop multiple lenders.** Rates can vary by 0.25% to 0.75% between lenders on the same day. Always get at least three quotes.\n\n**Consider buying points.** Paying 1% of your loan amount upfront can reduce your rate by about 0.25%. This makes sense if you plan to stay in the home for 5+ years.\n\n**Look into first-time buyer programs.** Many states offer down payment assistance or reduced-rate mortgages for qualified buyers.\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nRather than doing all this math by hand, use our free [Loan Calculator](/loan) to instantly see your monthly payment, total interest, and full amortization schedule.

Or maybe your boss just told you that revenue grew \"by 18% this quarter\" and you're nodding along, not entirely sure what that means in real dollars. Percentages are everywhere — and once you understand the basics, they're surprisingly simple.\n\nThis guide breaks down everything you need to know about calculating percentages, with clear examples you can actually use.\n\n## What Is a Percentage?\n\nA percentage is just a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word itself comes from Latin — \"per centum\" — meaning \"by the hundred.\" So when you see 45%, it literally means 45 out of every 100.\n\nHere's the core formula:\n\n**Percentage = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100**\n\nThat's it. Every percentage problem is some variation of this formula.\n\n## Three Types of Percentage Problems\n\nMost real-world percentage questions fall into one of three categories. Let's walk through each one.\n\n### Type 1: What Is X% of Y?\n\nThis is the most common one — finding a specific percentage of a number.\n\n**Formula:** Result = (Percentage ÷ 100) × Number\n\n**Example:** What is 15% of 200?\n- 15 ÷ 100 = 0.15\n- 0.15 × 200 = **30**\n\nYou'd use this when calculating tips, discounts, tax amounts, or commission rates.\n\n### Type 2: X Is What Percent of Y?\n\nHere you know the part and the whole, and you need to find the percentage.\n\n**Formula:** Percentage = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100\n\n**Example:** You scored 42 out of 50 on a test. What percentage is that?\n- 42 ÷ 50 = 0.84\n- 0.84 × 100 = **84%**\n\n### Type 3: X Is Y% of What Number?\n\nThis is the reverse calculation — you know the percentage and the result, but need to find the original number.\n\n**Formula:** Whole = Part ÷ (Percentage ÷ 100)\n\n**Example:** 30 is 25% of what number?\n- 30 ÷ (25 ÷ 100) = 30 ÷ 0.25 = **120**\n\n## How to Calculate Percentage Increase and Decrease\n\nPercentage change shows how much something has grown or shrunk relative to its original value.\n\n**Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) ÷ Old Value) × 100**\n\nA positive result means an increase. A negative result means a decrease.\n\n**Example — Increase:** Your rent went from $1,200 to $1,350.\n- (1,350 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **12.5% increase**\n\n**Example — Decrease:** Gas dropped from $4.00 to $3.40 per gallon.\n- (3.40 - 4.00) ÷ 4.00 × 100 = **-15% decrease**\n\n## Quick Mental Math Tricks\n\nYou don't always need a calculator. These shortcuts help:\n\n**Finding 10%:** Just move the decimal point one place to the left. 10% of $85 = $8.50.\n\n**Finding 5%:** Find 10% first, then halve it. 5% of $85 = $4.25.\n\n**Finding 20%:** Find 10% and double it. 20% of $85 = $17.\n\n**Finding 15% (great for tips):** Find 10% + half of 10%. For an $85 bill: $8.50 + $4.25 = $12.75 tip.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nPercentages show up constantly in daily life. Here are the most common situations:\n\n**Shopping discounts** — A $60 shirt at 30% off costs $60 × 0.70 = $42.\n\n**Restaurant tips** — 18% on a $55 meal: $55 × 0.18 = $9.90.\n\n**Sales tax** — 8.5% tax on a $299 laptop: $299 × 0.085 = $25.42, total = $324.42.\n\n**Salary raise** — 4% raise on $65,000: $65,000 × 0.04 = $2,600 raise, new salary = $67,600.\n\n**Grade calculations** — 87 correct out of 100 questions = 87%.\n\n## Use Our Free Percentage Calculator\n\nDon't want to do the math by hand? Our [percentage calculator](/percentage/) handles all three types of percentage problems instantly. Just enter your numbers and get the answer — no formulas needed.\n\nWe also offer a [discount calculator](/discount/) for shopping deals and a [tip calculator](/tip/) for restaurants.","src/content/posts/how-to-calculate-percentage.md","7fb9d7dcd2de83c1",{"html":1131,"metadata":1132},"\u003Cp>Imagine you’re at the store staring at a “35% off” sign, trying to figure out the actual price in your head.

Obviously, no one else actually got richer — but the mean income in the room just skyrocketed.\n\nThis classic example shows why understanding different types of averages matters. The wrong average can be actively misleading.\n\n## The Three Averages\n\n**Mean** is what most people think of as \"the average.\" Add all values together, divide by the count. For test scores of 80, 85, 90, 92, 95: mean = 442 ÷ 5 = 88.4.\n\n**Median** is the middle value when all numbers are sorted in order. For those same scores (80, 85, 90, 92, 95), the median is 90 — the value right in the center.\n\n**Mode** is the most frequently occurring value. If the scores were 80, 85, 90, 90, 95, the mode is 90 because it appears twice.\n\n## When Each Average Matters\n\n**Use the mean when** data is evenly distributed without extreme outliers. Good for: test scores in a normal class, daily temperatures over a month, consistent sales data.\n\n**Use the median when** data has outliers or is skewed. Good for: income and salary data, housing prices, response times (where a few very slow responses skew the mean).\n\n**Use the mode when** you want the most common value. Good for: clothing sizes, survey responses, most popular choices.\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n**Salary negotiation.** A company says the \"average salary\" for your role is $85,000. If that's the mean, it could be skewed by a few executives making $200,000+. Ask for the median instead — it's a more honest representation.\n\n**Housing prices.** Your agent says the average home in the neighborhood sold for $500,000. If one mansion sold for $2 million, the mean is inflated. The median selling price is more useful for budgeting.\n\n**Student grades.** A class with scores of 45, 50, 88, 90, 92, 95, 98 has a mean of 79.7 and a median of 90. The mean suggests the class is struggling, but the median shows most students are doing well — two very low scores are pulling the mean down.\n\n**Product reviews.** A product with ratings of 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 has a mean of 3.86 stars. But the mode is 5 and the median is 5. Most people love it, but a couple hate it. The mean alone misses this bimodal pattern.\n\n## Weighted Averages in Daily Life\n\nWeighted averages appear more often than you realize. Your college GPA weights grades by credit hours. Consumer Price Index weights different categories by spending patterns. Even your credit score uses a weighted formula — payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of history (15%), new credit (10%), and credit mix (10%).\n\n## The Standard Deviation Factor\n\nAverages alone don't tell the full story. Two students with 85% averages could have very different profiles: Student A scored 84, 85, 85, 86, 85 (consistent) while Student B scored 60, 70, 95, 100, 100 (volatile).\n\nStandard deviation measures this spread. Low standard deviation means scores cluster near the average. High standard deviation means wide variation.\n\n## Calculate Any Average\n\nOur free [Average Calculator](/average) computes the mean, and you can use it with our other tools to analyze data sets quickly. For weighted grades specifically, try our [Grade Calculator](/grade) or [GPA Calculator](/gpa).","src/content/posts/mean-median-mode-explained.md","12d6ff86ba12972f",{"html":1201,"metadata":1202},"\u003Cp>If Bill Gates walks into a bar with 99 other people, the average person in that bar is a billionaire.

Credit card debt and loans also compound. A $5,000 credit card balance at 24% APR grows to over $8,900 in just 3 years if you only make minimum payments.","Here's a mind-bending fact: if you invested just $100 per month starting at age 25 with a 10% average annual return, you'd have over $1.1 million by age 65. Wait until 35 to start the same investment, and you'd end up with only about $395,000. That 10-year delay cost you over $700,000 — even though you only missed $12,000 in actual contributions.\n\nThis is the magic of compound interest, and understanding it is the single most important financial concept you'll ever learn.\n\n## How Compound Interest Works\n\nSimple interest pays you only on your original deposit. If you invest $1,000 at 10% simple interest, you earn $100 every year — forever.\n\nCompound interest pays you on your original deposit plus all the interest you've already earned. That same $1,000 at 10% compound interest earns $100 the first year, $110 the second year, $121 the third year, and keeps accelerating.\n\nAfter 30 years, that $1,000 with simple interest would be worth $4,000. With compound interest, it would be worth $17,449. Same starting amount, same interest rate — but compounding produced more than four times the result.\n\n## The Rule of 72\n\nWant a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money? Divide 72 by your interest rate.\n\nAt 6% return, your money doubles every 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12). At 8%, it doubles every 9 years. At 10%, every 7.2 years. At 12%, every 6 years.\n\nThis means $10,000 invested at 10% becomes $20,000 in about 7 years, $40,000 in 14 years, $80,000 in 21 years, and $160,000 in 28 years — without adding a single extra dollar.\n\n## Real-World Scenarios\n\n**The early starter:** Investing $200/month from age 22 to 65 at 8% average return gives you approximately $945,000. Total invested: $103,200. Interest earned: $841,800.\n\n**The late starter:** Investing $400/month from age 35 to 65 at 8% gives you approximately $589,000. Total invested: $144,000. Interest earned: $445,000.\n\nThe early starter invested less money but ended up with 60% more, because those extra 13 years of compounding made an enormous difference.\n\n**The coffee trade:** Skipping a $5 daily coffee and investing it instead ($150/month) from age 25 to 65 at 9% average return produces about $884,000. Your lattes literally cost you nearly a million dollars.\n\n## How to Maximize Compound Interest\n\n**Start immediately.** The single most important factor is time. Even $50/month is better than waiting until you can afford $500/month.\n\n**Reinvest everything.** If your investments pay dividends, reinvest them automatically. Every dollar reinvested starts compounding on its own.\n\n**Increase contributions over time.** If you get a 3% raise, put at least 1% of it toward your investments. You won't miss it, but your future self will thank you.\n\n**Minimize fees.** A 1% management fee might sound small, but over 30 years it can eat 25–30% of your total returns. Choose low-cost index funds when possible.\n\n## The Dark Side of Compounding\n\nCompound interest works against you with debt. A $10,000 credit card balance at 22% APR with minimum payments takes over 30 years to pay off and costs over $23,000 in interest — more than double the original balance.\n\nThis is why paying off high-interest debt should always be your first priority before investing.\n\n## Run Your Own Numbers\n\nCurious how your money could grow? Use our free [Compound Interest Calculator](/compound-interest) to see exactly how much your investments will be worth over time.

Quick — what's the first number that comes to mind? If you said 37 or 73, you're not alone. Humans are terrible at being random. We gravitate toward odd numbers, avoid patterns, and unconsciously favor certain digits.\n\nThat's why we need random number generators — and they're far more important than you might think.\n\n## How Random Number Generators Work\n\nThere are two main types of random number generators: true random and pseudo-random.\n\n**True random number generators (TRNG)** harvest randomness from physical phenomena. Random.org, for example, uses atmospheric noise. Other systems use radioactive decay, thermal noise in electronic circuits, or even lava lamps (Cloudflare famously uses a wall of lava lamps to generate encryption keys).\n\n**Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG)** use mathematical algorithms. They start with a \"seed\" value and apply a formula to produce a sequence of numbers that appears random. The most common algorithm is the Mersenne Twister, which has a period of 2^19937-1 — meaning it generates that many numbers before the sequence repeats.\n\nFor almost every everyday purpose, pseudo-random is perfectly fine. You don't need quantum physics to decide who does the dishes tonight.\n\n## Everyday Uses for Random Numbers\n\n**Settling decisions.** Can't agree on where to eat? Generate a random number to pick from your list. It's faster than arguing for 30 minutes and ending up at the same place anyway.\n\n**Games and activities.** Board games, classroom activities, raffle drawings, and team assignments all benefit from unbiased random selection.\n\n**Statistics and research.** Random sampling is fundamental to valid research. If you're surveying 100 people from a list of 10,000, random selection prevents bias.\n\n**Security.** Encryption keys, password generation, and authentication tokens all depend on randomness. The more unpredictable, the more secure.\n\n**Creative projects.** Writers use random prompts to break through creative blocks. Musicians use random note generators for inspiration. Artists use randomized color palettes.\n\n## The Gambler's Fallacy\n\nOne of the most common mistakes with randomness is the gambler's fallacy — the belief that past outcomes influence future random events.\n\nIf a fair coin lands heads five times in a row, many people feel that tails is \"due.\" It's not. The probability of tails on the sixth flip is still exactly 50%. The coin has no memory.\n\nThis fallacy costs gamblers billions of dollars every year. In 1913, at the Monte Carlo Casino, the roulette ball landed on black 26 times in a row. Gamblers lost millions betting on red, convinced it had to come up next. The probability of 26 blacks in a row is about 1 in 67 million — rare, but not impossible, and each spin was still independent.\n\n## Fair Random Selection Tips\n\nWhen using random numbers for group decisions, transparency matters. Generate the number where everyone can see the result. Agree on the rules before generating. And use a tool rather than asking someone to \"pick a number\" — human-chosen numbers are never truly random.\n\n## Try It Now\n\nNeed a random number for any purpose?

Will it fit in your living room?\n\nWhether you're traveling, shopping internationally, or just trying to understand a recipe from another country, length conversions come up constantly.\n\n## The Essential Conversion Factors\n\nFor everyday use, these are the key numbers to know.\n\n**Inches and centimeters:** 1 inch = 2.54 cm. Or flip it: 1 cm = 0.394 inches. Quick mental math: divide centimeters by 2.5 for a rough inch estimate.\n\n**Feet and meters:** 1 foot = 0.3048 meters. 1 meter = 3.281 feet. Quick trick: a meter is a little more than 3 feet — about 3 feet 3 inches.\n\n**Miles and kilometers:** 1 mile = 1.609 km. 1 km = 0.621 miles. Quick trick: multiply km by 0.6 to get miles, or multiply miles by 1.6 to get km.\n\n## Height Conversions\n\nHeight is one of the most common conversions people search for, especially on dating apps and international forms.\n\n150 cm = 4'11\". 155 cm = 5'1\". 160 cm = 5'3\". 165 cm = 5'5\". 170 cm = 5'7\". 175 cm = 5'9\". 180 cm = 5'11\". 185 cm = 6'1\". 190 cm = 6'3\". 195 cm = 6'5\". 200 cm = 6'7\".\n\nThe average American man is about 5'9\" (175 cm) and the average American woman is about 5'4\" (163 cm).\n\n## Distance for Runners\n\nIf you run or walk for fitness, knowing these distances helps translate workout data. One lap around a standard track is 400 meters (about 0.25 miles). A common running route of 3 miles is approximately 4.8 km.\n\nFor race distances: a 5K is 3.1 miles, a 10K is 6.2 miles, a half marathon is 13.1 miles (21.1 km), and a full marathon is 26.2 miles (42.2 km).\n\nIf your treadmill shows speed in km/h but you think in mph: 8 km/h is about 5 mph (a brisk walk), 10 km/h is 6.2 mph (a light jog), 12 km/h is 7.5 mph (a solid run), and 16 km/h is about 10 mph (a fast run).\n\n## Around the House\n\nFurniture shopping internationally? A \"queen size\" bed in the US is 60 × 80 inches (152 × 203 cm). European double beds are often 140 × 200 cm (55 × 79 inches) — slightly narrower and shorter.\n\nStandard US ceiling height is 8 feet (2.44 m) or 9 feet (2.74 m) in newer construction. A standard interior door is 6'8\" tall (203 cm) and 2'8\" to 3'0\" wide (81-91 cm).\n\n## The Fibonacci Trick\n\nHere's a fun math trick for miles/kilometers: the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89) roughly converts between the two. Consecutive Fibonacci numbers approximate miles-to-km conversions: 5 miles ≈ 8 km, 8 miles ≈ 13 km, 13 miles ≈ 21 km. It works because the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches 1.618, close to the 1.609 km/mile conversion.\n\n## Convert Anything\n\nOur free [Length Converter](/length) handles instant conversions between inches, feet, yards, miles, millimeters, centimeters, meters, and kilometers.

When you break it down to an hourly rate and compare it against your living costs, the picture might look very different.\n\nConversely, if you're hourly at $22/hour, what does that actually translate to as an annual income? Knowing how to convert between salary and hourly pay is essential for evaluating job offers, negotiating raises, and understanding your real earning power.\n\n## The Basic Conversion\n\n**Annual salary to hourly rate:** Divide by 2,080 (52 weeks × 40 hours per week). $50,000 ÷ 2,080 = $24.04/hour. $75,000 ÷ 2,080 = $36.06/hour. $100,000 ÷ 2,080 = $48.08/hour.\n\n**Hourly rate to annual salary:** Multiply by 2,080. $15/hour × 2,080 = $31,200/year. $25/hour × 2,080 = $52,000/year. $40/hour × 2,080 = $83,200/year.\n\n**The quick mental shortcut:** For salary to hourly, drop the last three zeros and divide by 2. For $70,000: 70 ÷ 2 = $35/hour (actual: $33.65 — close enough).\n\n## What About Taxes?\n\nYour salary is gross pay — before taxes. Your actual take-home (net pay) is significantly less.\n\nOn a $60,000 salary, a single filer with no special deductions takes home roughly $47,000-$50,000 after federal income tax, Social Security (6.2%), Medicare (1.45%), and state income tax (varies by state).\n\nThat means your real hourly rate isn't $28.85 — it's more like $22.60-$24.00 after taxes.\n\nStates with no income tax (Texas, Florida, Washington, Nevada, Tennessee, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, New Hampshire) effectively give you a 3-10% raise compared to high-tax states like California or New York.\n\n## The Hidden Value of Benefits\n\nWhen comparing a salaried position to freelance or contract work, factor in employer-provided benefits. Typical benefit values include health insurance ($5,000-$15,000/year for employer's share), 401(k) match ($1,500-$6,000/year), paid time off ($3,000-$8,000 value for 15-20 days), and other benefits like dental, vision, and life insurance.\n\nA $70,000 salary with full benefits might be worth $85,000-$95,000 in total compensation, equivalent to $41-$46/hour.\n\nA freelancer earning $50/hour sounds like more, but after self-employment tax (15.3%), health insurance ($500+/month), no paid vacation, and no retirement match, the true comparison is much closer.\n\n## What Is a Living Wage?\n\nThe MIT Living Wage Calculator estimates what a person actually needs to earn to cover basic expenses. In 2026, a single adult with no children needs roughly $18-$22/hour in lower-cost areas and $25-$35/hour in expensive metro areas.\n\nFor a family of four with one working parent, the living wage ranges from $30/hour in affordable areas to $50+/hour in cities like San Francisco or New York.\n\n## Evaluating a Job Offer\n\nDon't just compare base salary numbers. Calculate the effective hourly rate including expected overtime and commute time.\n\nA $60,000 job with strict 40-hour weeks = $28.85/hour. The same $60,000 with expected 50-hour weeks = $23.08/hour. If that job also requires a 1-hour daily commute (10 hours/week), your time-adjusted rate is closer to $20/hour.\n\nMeanwhile, a $55,000 remote job at 40 hours/week with no commute = $26.44/hour of your actual time — arguably a better deal.\n\n## Calculate Your Rate\n\nUse our free [Salary Calculator](/salary) to instantly convert between hourly, weekly, biweekly, monthly, and annual pay rates.

It's not as obvious as it seems — and knowing how to convert between the two is essential for making smart career decisions.\n\n## The Basic Formula\n\n**Hourly Rate = Annual Salary ÷ 2,080**\n\nWhere does 2,080 come from? That's 52 weeks × 40 hours per week — the standard full-time work year in the US.\n\n**Common salary-to-hourly conversions:**\n\n| Annual Salary | Hourly Rate | Monthly Take-Home (est.) |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $35,000 | $16.83 | ~$2,400 |\n| $45,000 | $21.63 | ~$3,000 |\n| $55,000 | $26.44 | ~$3,600 |\n| $65,000 | $31.25 | ~$4,200 |\n| $75,000 | $36.06 | ~$4,800 |\n| $85,000 | $40.87 | ~$5,400 |\n| $100,000 | $48.08 | ~$6,200 |\n\n*Monthly take-home estimates assume roughly 25-30% combined federal, state, and payroll taxes.*\n\n## The Quick Mental Math Trick\n\n**To estimate your hourly rate from salary:** Drop the last three zeros and divide by 2.\n\n- $60,000 → 60 ÷ 2 = **~$30/hour** (actual: $28.85)\n- $80,000 → 80 ÷ 2 = **~$40/hour** (actual: $38.46)\n- $100,000 → 100 ÷ 2 = **~$50/hour** (actual: $48.08)\n\nIt's not exact, but it gets you close enough for quick comparisons.\n\n**To estimate salary from hourly rate:** Double the rate and add three zeros.\n\n- $25/hour → 25 × 2 = **~$50,000/year** (actual: $52,000)\n- $35/hour → 35 × 2 = **~$70,000/year** (actual: $72,800)\n\n## Your Real Hourly Rate (The Honest Version)\n\nThe formula above assumes you work exactly 40 hours a week. But many salaried employees work more. If you regularly put in 50-hour weeks, your effective hourly rate drops significantly.\n\n**$75,000 salary at different weekly hours:**\n- 40 hours/week: $36.06/hour\n- 45 hours/week: $32.05/hour\n- 50 hours/week: $28.85/hour\n- 55 hours/week: $26.22/hour\n- 60 hours/week: $24.04/hour\n\nA salaried employee working 60-hour weeks at $75,000 makes less per hour than someone earning $25/hour at 40 hours.\n\n## Comparing Job Offers: Beyond the Number\n\nWhen evaluating offers, salary or hourly rate is just one piece. Consider:\n\n**Health insurance** — Employer-provided health coverage is worth $6,000-$20,000/year. An hourly job without benefits might actually pay less when you factor in buying your own insurance.\n\n**Retirement match** — A 5% 401(k) match on a $70,000 salary adds $3,500/year in free money.\n\n**Paid time off** — Two weeks of PTO on a salaried job means you're still paid for 52 weeks of work. An hourly worker taking two weeks off loses two weeks of pay.\n\n**Overtime** — Hourly workers often earn 1.5× their rate for overtime hours. If you consistently work 50+ hours, an hourly position might earn more than a comparable salary.\n\n## Freelancer Rate Calculation\n\nIf you're freelancing or consulting, your rate needs to be higher than an employee rate to cover:\n\n- Self-employment tax (~15.3%)\n- Health insurance ($300-800/month)\n- No paid vacation or sick days\n- Business expenses\n- Unpaid time spent on admin, marketing, invoicing\n\n**Rule of thumb:** Multiply the employee hourly rate by 1.3-1.5 to get a freelance rate.\n\nAn employee making $40/hour should freelance at $52-60/hour to have equivalent take-home pay.\n\n## Calculate Your Rate\n\nUse our free [salary calculator](/salary/) to instantly convert between annual, monthly, biweekly, weekly, and hourly rates. For budgeting your income, try our [percentage calculator](/percentage/) to split your paycheck using the 50/30/20 rule.\n\n*This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.*","src/content/posts/salary-to-hourly-conversion.md","57e56bf15bc9c131",{"html":1480,"metadata":1481},"\u003Cp>Your offer letter says $72,000 per year.

For example, a 32 oz bottle of juice for $3.84 has a unit price of $3.84 ÷ 32 = $0.12 per ounce.","You're standing in the cereal aisle staring at two boxes of the same brand. The 18 oz box is $4.29. The 24 oz box is $5.49. Which one is the better deal?\n\nYour gut says the bigger box — but is it? This is where unit pricing saves you real money.\n\n## What Is Unit Price?\n\nUnit price is simply the cost per standard unit — per ounce, per pound, per item, per sheet, etc. It strips away the packaging differences and lets you compare apples to apples.\n\n**Formula:** Unit Price = Total Price ÷ Total Quantity\n\n**Back to our cereal example:**\n- 18 oz box at $4.29 → $4.29 ÷ 18 = **$0.238 per ounce**\n- 24 oz box at $5.49 → $5.49 ÷ 24 = **$0.229 per ounce**\n\nThe bigger box wins — but only by about a penny per ounce. That's $0.22 saved total. If the smaller box is more convenient or you won't finish the bigger one before it goes stale, the savings might not be worth it.\n\n## When Bigger Isn't Cheaper\n\nHere are real scenarios where the bulk price loses:\n\n**Sale on the smaller size.** A 12-pack of soda at $5.99 ($0.50/can) vs. a 24-pack at $13.99 ($0.58/can). The smaller pack is actually cheaper per unit because it's on sale.\n\n**Store brand vs. name brand.** A 16 oz name-brand ketchup at $3.49 ($0.218/oz) vs. a 32 oz store brand at $3.99 ($0.125/oz). The store brand is nearly half the unit price.\n\n**Different stores.** The \"bulk\" price at one store may be higher than the regular price at a discount grocer.\n\n## Products Where Unit Price Matters Most\n\nSome categories have huge unit price variation:\n\n**Paper products** — Toilet paper and paper towels vary wildly. Always compare price per sheet or per square foot, not per roll (rolls have different sizes).\n\n**Cleaning supplies** — Concentrated vs. regular formulas make total price misleading.\n\n**Beverages** — Bottled water, juice, and soda have massive per-ounce differences between sizes and brands.\n\n**Snacks** — Family-size bags are usually cheaper per ounce, but individual servings at dollar stores can sometimes beat them.\n\n**Pet food** — Larger bags almost always have a significantly lower unit price.\n\n## How to Use Unit Price While Shopping\n\n**Step 1:** Check the shelf label. Most US grocery stores are required to show unit price. Look for the small print that says \"price per oz\" or \"price per count.\"\n\n**Step 2:** Compare within the same unit. Make sure you're comparing ounce-to-ounce or count-to-count. A paper towel priced \"per roll\" can't be compared to one priced \"per sheet.\"\n\n**Step 3:** Factor in waste. A bulk package of fresh produce that goes bad before you eat it has an effective unit price of infinity on the wasted portion.\n\n**Step 4:** Consider storage. Buying 48 rolls of toilet paper is great per-unit but only if you have somewhere to put it.\n\n## How Much Can You Actually Save?\n\nStudies suggest that consistent unit price comparison saves the average family $500-1,500 per year on groceries. That's real money — and it takes just seconds per item once you develop the habit.\n\nThe biggest savings come from three switches: store brands over name brands, optimal package sizes, and buying staples on sale.\n\n## Calculate Unit Price Instantly\n\nCan't read the shelf label?

With the deal, two 20 oz bottles (40 oz total) cost $5.24, or $0.131 per ounce — significantly cheaper than the single 32 oz bottle.\n\nThis is why unit price matters. The deal that looks obvious often isn't.\n\n## How to Calculate Unit Price\n\nThe formula is simple: Unit Price = Total Price ÷ Total Quantity.\n\n$4.99 for 32 oz: $4.99 ÷ 32 = $0.156 per ounce. $7.99 for 64 oz: $7.99 ÷ 64 = $0.125 per ounce. $2.99 for 12 oz: $2.99 ÷ 12 = $0.249 per ounce.\n\nThe lowest unit price is the best value, assuming you'll actually use the full amount before it expires.\n\n## Common Shopping Traps\n\n**The \"family size\" assumption.** Family and bulk sizes are usually cheaper per unit, but not always. During sales, regular sizes with promotions frequently beat bulk prices. Check every time.\n\n**Different unit measurements.** One brand lists price per ounce, another lists price per 100 grams. You can't compare directly without converting. Our [Unit Price Calculator](/unit-price) handles this automatically.\n\n**Ignoring expiration dates.** A gallon of milk at $0.04/oz beats a half gallon at $0.05/oz — unless you can't drink a full gallon before it spoils. The \"savings\" disappear if you throw away 30% of the product.\n\n**Multi-buy deals.** \"3 for $10\" sounds great, but if the regular price is $3.49 each, you're only saving $0.49 total — and you might not need three. Worse, some stores set the \"3 for $10\" price at exactly $3.33 each, meaning there's no savings at all.\n\n## Where Unit Price Saves the Most\n\nThe biggest savings come from items you buy frequently. Even small per-unit differences add up dramatically over a year.\n\n**Cereal:** Premium brands can cost $0.35/oz while store brands run $0.15/oz. On 2 boxes per month, switching saves about $60/year.\n\n**Beverages:** Single bottles cost $0.05-$0.10/oz while multi-packs run $0.02-$0.04/oz. A family drinking 5 bottles per week saves $100+/year.\n\n**Cleaning supplies:** Concentrated formulas at $0.10/oz dilute to effectively $0.02/oz, while ready-to-use versions cost $0.06/oz. Smart concentrate buying saves $30-$50/year.\n\n**Paper products:** Toilet paper ranges from $0.03 to $0.08 per square foot depending on brand, size, and deals. Consistent unit price shopping saves $40-$70/year.\n\n## The Costco Question\n\nIs a warehouse membership worth it? The math depends on what you buy.\n\nFor non-perishable staples, cleaning supplies, and paper products, Costco's unit prices are typically 20-40% below grocery stores. For a family spending $200/month on these categories, the savings easily cover the $65 annual membership.\n\nBut warehouse shopping has traps: impulse purchases on items you wouldn't normally buy, perishable bulk food that goes to waste, and the $1.50 hot dog combo that somehow turns every trip into a $300 expedition.\n\n## Start Saving Today\n\nUse our free [Unit Price Calculator](/unit-price) to quickly compare any two (or more) products side by side.

If you've ever stared at your screen trying to do this math, you're not alone.\n\n## The Four Main US Time Zones\n\nThe contiguous United States spans four time zones, each one hour apart:\n\n| Time Zone | Abbreviation | UTC Offset | Major Cities |\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|\n| Eastern | EST (EDT) | UTC-5 (-4) | New York, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Washington DC |\n| Central | CST (CDT) | UTC-6 (-5) | Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Nashville, New Orleans |\n| Mountain | MST (MDT) | UTC-7 (-6) | Denver, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque |\n| Pacific | PST (PDT) | UTC-8 (-7) | Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland |\n\n**The quick rule:** When moving west, subtract one hour per zone. When moving east, add one hour.\n\nSo if it's **3:00 PM Eastern**, it's:\n- 2:00 PM Central\n- 1:00 PM Mountain\n- 12:00 PM Pacific\n\n## Quick Conversion Cheat Sheet\n\n| Eastern | Central | Mountain | Pacific |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 9 AM | 8 AM | 7 AM | 6 AM |\n| 10 AM | 9 AM | 8 AM | 7 AM |\n| 12 PM | 11 AM | 10 AM | 9 AM |\n| 1 PM | 12 PM | 11 AM | 10 AM |\n| 3 PM | 2 PM | 1 PM | 12 PM |\n| 5 PM | 4 PM | 3 PM | 2 PM |\n| 8 PM | 7 PM | 6 PM | 5 PM |\n\n## Daylight Saving Time (DST)\n\nTwice a year, most of the US shifts its clocks:\n\n**Spring Forward:** Second Sunday in March — clocks jump from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM. You lose one hour of sleep.\n\n**Fall Back:** First Sunday in November — clocks go from 2:00 AM back to 1:00 AM. You gain one hour.\n\nDuring DST, the abbreviations change: EST becomes EDT, CST becomes CDT, etc. The \"D\" stands for \"Daylight.\"\n\n**Exceptions:** Arizona (except the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii do NOT observe daylight saving time. They stay on standard time year-round. This means Arizona is on the same time as Pacific during summer and Mountain during winter.\n\n## Scheduling Across Time Zones\n\n**The sweet spot for coast-to-coast meetings:** 12 PM - 2 PM Eastern (9 AM - 11 AM Pacific). This window falls within normal business hours for both coasts.\n\n**Bad meeting times to avoid:**\n- Before 12 PM Eastern = before 9 AM Pacific (too early for the West Coast)\n- After 5 PM Pacific = after 8 PM Eastern (too late for the East Coast)\n\n## Beyond the Contiguous US\n\n| Territory | Time Zone | UTC Offset |\n|:---|:---|:---:|\n| Alaska | AKST/AKDT | UTC-9 (-8) |\n| Hawaii | HST | UTC-10 |\n| Guam | ChST | UTC+10 |\n| Puerto Rico | AST | UTC-4 |\n\nHawaii is 5 hours behind Eastern and 2 hours behind Pacific.

Your meal was $47.50, and now you're staring at the tip line wondering if you're about to commit a social faux pas.\n\nOr maybe you're American and still not sure what to tip the hotel housekeeper, the hairdresser, or the Uber driver. You're not alone — tipping culture is complicated, inconsistent, and constantly changing.\n\nHere's the definitive guide.\n\n## Restaurant Tipping\n\n**Sit-down restaurants:** 18-20% of the pre-tax bill is standard for good service. For exceptional service, 20-25%. For poor service, 15% (never zero — if service was truly terrible, speak to a manager).\n\n**Buffets:** 10-15%. Someone is still clearing plates, refilling drinks, and maintaining the buffet.\n\n**Counter service / fast casual:** 0-15%. Tipping at counter service places is optional. The tip screen at checkout creates social pressure, but there's no obligation.\n\n**Bartenders:** $1-2 per drink for beer/wine, $2-3 per cocktail, or 18-20% of a tab.\n\n**Takeout:** 0-15%. Increasingly common post-COVID. Tip more for large or complex orders.\n\n## Delivery Tipping\n\n**Food delivery (DoorDash, Uber Eats):** $3-5 minimum or 15-20% of the order, whichever is higher. In bad weather, tip more. Remember that drivers use their own gas and car.\n\n**Pizza delivery:** $3-5 for a normal order. $5+ for large orders or long distances. At least $3 even for a single pizza.\n\n**Grocery delivery (Instacart):** 15-20% of the order total. Your shopper is selecting items, carrying heavy bags, and driving to you.\n\n## Personal Services\n\n**Hair salon:** 15-20% of the service cost. If the salon owner cuts your hair, tipping is optional but appreciated.\n\n**Nail salon:** 15-20%. Cash is strongly preferred.\n\n**Massage:** 15-20% of the service price.\n\n**Spa services:** 15-20%. Check if gratuity is included.\n\n**Tattoo artists:** 15-25%. For large pieces, some people bring food or drinks as well.\n\n## Travel Tipping\n\n**Hotel housekeeping:** $2-5 per night. Leave it daily (different staff may clean each day) with a note saying \"Thank you\" so they know it's a tip.\n\n**Hotel bellhop:** $1-2 per bag, minimum $3-5.\n\n**Hotel concierge:** $5-20 depending on the complexity of help provided (restaurant reservations vs. hard-to-get tickets).\n\n**Valet parking:** $3-5 when your car is returned.\n\n**Taxi/rideshare:** 15-20%. Many ride-share apps make this easy with post-ride tipping.\n\n**Tour guides:** $5-10 per person for group tours, more for private tours.\n\n## Quick Mental Math\n\nThe easiest way to calculate a tip: find 10% by moving the decimal point, then adjust.\n\nFor $47.50: 10% is $4.75. For 20%, double it: $9.50. For 15%, add half of 10% to 10%: $4.75 + $2.38 = $7.13.\n\nOr use our free [Tip Calculator](/tip) to instantly split the bill and calculate the perfect tip amount for any group size.","src/content/posts/us-tipping-guide-complete.md","bcbc8468026e7770",{"html":1705,"metadata":1706},"\u003Cp>You’re visiting the US for the first time.

A zero on a 30%-weighted final drops an otherwise 90% student to a 63% — from an A to a D.","It's Week 12. You've gotten an 88 on the midterm, averaged 75 on homework, and scored 92 on the paper. Your final exam is worth 40% of the grade. Can you still get an A? And what's the minimum score you need to keep a B?\n\nThese are the questions every student asks at the end of the semester. Here's how to answer them.\n\n## How Weighted Grades Work\n\nMost college courses use weighted grading, where different assignments count for different percentages of your final grade. A typical breakdown might look like homework 20%, midterm 20%, paper 20%, and final exam 40%.\n\nTo calculate your current grade, multiply each component's grade by its weight. Using the example above: Homework (20%): 75 × 0.20 = 15. Midterm (20%): 88 × 0.20 = 17.6. Paper (20%): 92 × 0.20 = 18.4. Your accumulated grade so far: 15 + 17.6 + 18.4 = 51 out of 60 possible points (since 60% of the course is complete).\n\nYour current average: 51 ÷ 60 = 85% (a B).\n\n## What Score Do You Need on the Final?\n\nThe formula is: Final Score Needed = (Target Grade - Current Accumulated Points) ÷ Final Exam Weight.\n\nTo get an A (90% overall): (90 - 51) ÷ 0.40 = 97.5%. You'd need a 97.5% on the final. Tough but possible.\n\nTo keep a B (80% overall): (80 - 51) ÷ 0.40 = 72.5%. A 72.5% on the final keeps you at a B. Very achievable.\n\nTo pass with a C (70% overall): (70 - 51) ÷ 0.40 = 47.5%. Even scoring below 50% on the final still passes the class.\n\n## The Drop-Lowest Policy\n\nMany professors drop your lowest homework or quiz score. This can significantly boost your grade. If you have 10 homework assignments and the lowest is dropped, your homework average is calculated from the best 9.\n\nIf your scores were 60, 75, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95, 100 — dropping the 60 raises your homework average from 84.7% to 87.4%.\n\n## Extra Credit Math\n\nExtra credit typically adds points directly to a category. If your midterm was 88/100 and the professor offers 5 points extra credit, your midterm becomes 93/100. At 20% weight, those 5 points are worth 1 full percentage point on your final grade (5 × 0.20 = 1.0).\n\nAlways do extra credit. Even small amounts compound across a semester.\n\n## Study Strategy Based on Math\n\nIf your final is worth 40% and you currently have an 85%, here's a strategic reality check.\n\nStudying to improve from a B+ to an A requires scoring 97%+ on the final. That's a huge investment with uncertain returns.\n\nAlternatively, if you're borderline passing, the math might show that the final can't mathematically save you — in which case, talking to your professor about options (incomplete, withdrawal, extra credit) is a better use of your time.\n\n## Calculate It Now\n\nUse our free [Grade Calculator](/grade) to instantly figure out what you need on your final, or calculate your current weighted grade in any class. Just enter your scores and weights.\n\nFor cumulative GPA across all your classes, try our [GPA Calculator](/gpa).","src/content/posts/what-grade-do-i-need-on-final.md","9ac56d00c11ad007",{"html":1757,"metadata":1758},"\u003Cp>It’s Week 12.

Or you're ordering something online from Europe, and the shipping calculator wants your package weight in kilograms. If you grew up with pounds, these conversions don't come naturally.\n\nLet's fix that with a clear, practical guide to weight conversions.\n\n## The Core Formula\n\nThe key number to remember is 2.205.\n\nTo convert pounds to kilograms, divide by 2.205. So 170 pounds ÷ 2.205 = 77.1 kg.\n\nTo convert kilograms to pounds, multiply by 2.205. So 80 kg × 2.205 = 176.4 pounds.\n\nFor quick mental math, just use 2.2. It's close enough for most purposes and much easier to calculate in your head.\n\n## Quick Reference Chart\n\nHere are the most common conversions people search for:\n\n100 pounds is about 45.4 kg. 120 pounds is 54.4 kg. 140 pounds is 63.5 kg. 150 pounds is 68 kg. 160 pounds is 72.6 kg. 180 pounds is 81.6 kg. 200 pounds is 90.7 kg.\n\nGoing the other direction: 50 kg is 110.2 pounds. 60 kg is 132.3 pounds. 70 kg is 154.3 pounds. 75 kg is 165.3 pounds. 80 kg is 176.4 pounds. 90 kg is 198.4 pounds. 100 kg is 220.5 pounds.\n\n## Smaller Units: Ounces and Grams\n\nFor smaller weights — cooking, postage, jewelry — you'll need ounces and grams.\n\n1 ounce = 28.35 grams. 1 pound = 16 ounces = 453.6 grams. 1 kilogram = 1,000 grams = 35.27 ounces.\n\nA practical shortcut: 1 ounce is roughly 28 grams. So that 8-ounce steak is about 227 grams, and a 100-gram chocolate bar is about 3.5 ounces.\n\n## Why Two Systems Exist\n\nThe metric system was created in France in 1795, designed to be logical and consistent — everything based on factors of 10. The imperial system evolved organically from Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and other historical measurements.\n\nToday, only three countries haven't officially adopted the metric system: the United States, Myanmar, and Liberia. However, even in the US, metric is standard in science, medicine, the military, and international trade.\n\nThe ironic part? The US pound is officially defined in terms of the kilogram. One pound is legally defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms.\n\n## When Precision Matters\n\nFor cooking at home, rounding to the nearest gram is fine. But certain fields demand precision. Pharmaceuticals measure in milligrams. Gemstones use carats (1 carat = 0.2 grams). Precious metals use troy ounces (1 troy ounce = 31.1 grams, different from the standard 28.35-gram ounce).\n\n## Convert Instantly\n\nSkip the math and use our free [Weight Converter](/weight) for instant, accurate conversions between pounds, kilograms, ounces, grams, and more.","src/content/posts/weight-conversion-guide.md","4c5e51ec1cf845b2",{"html":1816,"metadata":1817},"\u003Cp>You’re at the gym in another country.
