faq:
  - q: "Is BMR the same as metabolism?"
    a: "BMR is one component of your metabolism — the calories your body burns at complete rest. Your total metabolism (TDEE) also includes calories burned through daily activity and exercise."
  - q: "Why is my BMR so high or low?"
    a: "BMR varies based on age, height, weight, gender, and muscle mass. Taller and more muscular people tend to have higher BMRs. BMR also naturally decreases with age."
  - q: "Should I eat below my BMR to lose weight?"
    a: "Eating below your BMR is generally not recommended. Your body needs those baseline calories to function properly. Instead, eat between your BMR and TDEE to create a safe calorie deficit."
  - q: "How accurate are BMR calculators?"
    a: "Online BMR calculators using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation are accurate within about 10% for most people. For precise measurements, you'd need indirect calorimetry testing."

Mike started a diet by eating 1,200 calories a day because that's what a random website recommended. Two weeks later he was exhausted, irritable, and hadn't lost a single pound. The problem wasn't willpower — he was eating way below his BMR, and his body was fighting back.

Understanding the difference between BMR and TDEE is the foundation of any smart nutrition plan, whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply eat better.

## What Is BMR?

BMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate. It's the number of calories your body burns just to stay alive — breathing, circulating blood, growing cells, and maintaining organ function. Think of it as the energy cost of simply existing.

For most adults, BMR accounts for 60–75% of total daily calories burned. A 30-year-old man who is 5'10" and weighs 180 pounds has a BMR of roughly 1,800 calories. A 30-year-old woman who is 5'5" and weighs 140 pounds has a BMR of about 1,400 calories.

The most widely used formula is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. For men, it's 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) – 5 × age – 5. For women, the same formula but subtract 161 instead of 5.

## What Is TDEE?

TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It's your BMR plus all the additional calories you burn through daily activities, exercise, and even digesting food.

TDEE is calculated by multiplying your BMR by an activity factor. If you're sedentary (desk job, little exercise), multiply by 1.2. Lightly active (exercise 1–3 days/week) is 1.375. Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days/week) is 1.55. Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week) is 1.725.

Using our example, the 180-pound man with a BMR of 1,800 who exercises 3–4 times per week has a TDEE of about 2,790 calories (1,800 × 1.55).

## Why This Matters for Weight Loss

Here's the key principle: to lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than your TDEE. To gain weight, eat more than your TDEE. To maintain, eat roughly at your TDEE.

A safe calorie deficit is 500–750 calories below your TDEE per day, which produces about 1–1.5 pounds of weight loss per week. For our example man with a TDEE of 2,790, eating around 2,000–2,290 calories daily would produce steady, sustainable weight loss.

The critical mistake many people make is eating below their BMR. Going under 1,800 calories in this case can trigger metabolic adaptation — your body slows down, conserves energy, and actually makes weight loss harder.

## How to Use These Numbers

**Step 1:** Calculate your BMR using our [Calorie Calculator](/calorie) — it uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation automatically.

**Step 2:** Determine your activity level honestly. Most people overestimate their activity. If you have a desk job and exercise 3 times a week, "lightly active" is probably more accurate than "moderately active."

**Step 3:** Set your calorie target. For weight loss, subtract 500 from your TDEE. For muscle gain, add 250–500. For maintenance, eat at your TDEE.

**Step 4:** Track for two weeks and adjust. If you're not seeing results, your TDEE estimate might be off. Reduce by 100 calories and reassess.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Dramatic calorie cutting** rarely works long-term. A 1,000+ calorie deficit leads to muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, and eventual binge eating.

**Ignoring protein** is another common error. When losing weight, aim for 0.7–1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to preserve muscle mass.

**Not recalculating** as you lose weight. Your BMR and TDEE decrease as you get lighter, so what worked at 200 pounds won't work the same at 170.
