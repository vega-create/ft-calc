faq:
  - q: "What GPA do I need for grad school?"
    a: "Most graduate programs require a minimum GPA of 3.0 (B average). Competitive programs like top MBA or medical schools often expect 3.5+."
  - q: "Is a 3.5 GPA good?"
    a: "Yes, a 3.5 GPA is considered very good. It typically means you're earning mostly A's and B's. It's competitive for most graduate programs and jobs."
  - q: "Can I raise my GPA in one semester?"
    a: "Yes, but how much depends on how many credits you've completed. A freshman can move their GPA significantly in one semester. A senior with 120+ credits will see smaller changes per semester."
  - q: "What's the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?"
    a: "Unweighted GPA uses the standard 4.0 scale. Weighted GPA gives extra points for honors or AP classes, so it can exceed 4.0 — sometimes going up to 5.0."

It's midway through your sophomore year and you just realized you need a 3.2 GPA to keep your scholarship. You have a pile of transcripts and grade reports, but no idea how to actually calculate the number. Sound familiar?

GPA calculation isn't complicated once you understand the system. Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is GPA?

GPA stands for Grade Point Average. In the US, it's measured on a 4.0 scale and represents the average of your grades weighted by credit hours.

**Standard 4.0 Scale:**

| Letter Grade | Grade Points |
|:---:|:---:|
| A / A+ | 4.0 |
| A- | 3.7 |
| B+ | 3.3 |
| B | 3.0 |
| B- | 2.7 |
| C+ | 2.3 |
| C | 2.0 |
| C- | 1.7 |
| D+ | 1.3 |
| D | 1.0 |
| F | 0.0 |

## How to Calculate GPA: Step by Step

Here's the process in four steps:

**Step 1:** Convert each letter grade to its grade point value.

**Step 2:** Multiply each grade point by the number of credit hours for that course.

**Step 3:** Add up all the quality points (grade points × credits).

**Step 4:** Divide total quality points by total credit hours.

**Example Semester:**

| Course | Grade | Points | Credits | Quality Points |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| English 101 | A | 4.0 | 3 | 12.0 |
| Calculus | B+ | 3.3 | 4 | 13.2 |
| Biology | B | 3.0 | 4 | 12.0 |
| History | A- | 3.7 | 3 | 11.1 |
| Art | A | 4.0 | 2 | 8.0 |

**Total quality points:** 56.3
**Total credits:** 16
**Semester GPA:** 56.3 ÷ 16 = **3.52**

## Cumulative GPA vs. Semester GPA

Your **semester GPA** covers just one term. Your **cumulative GPA** averages all semesters together, weighted by credits.

To calculate cumulative GPA, add up all quality points from all semesters and divide by all credit hours attempted.

## What's a Good GPA?

It depends on your goals, but here's a general framework:

- **3.7 - 4.0** — Excellent. Dean's list, summa cum laude territory.
- **3.5 - 3.69** — Very good. Magna cum laude range.
- **3.0 - 3.49** — Good. Meets most grad school minimums.
- **2.5 - 2.99** — Average. May limit some opportunities.
- **Below 2.0** — Academic probation at most schools.

## How to Raise Your GPA

The math is straightforward: you need enough high grades to pull the average up.

**The credit hour factor:** A student with 30 total credits can raise their GPA faster than a student with 100 credits, because each new grade has more relative weight.

**Strategic course selection:** Some students take easier electives to boost GPA, while also taking challenging courses in their major. It's a balancing act.

**Retake policies:** Many schools let you retake a course and replace the old grade. If you got a D in a 4-credit class, retaking it for an A replaces 4 quality points with 16 — a massive swing.
