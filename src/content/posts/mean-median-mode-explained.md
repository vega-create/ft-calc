faq:
  - q: "Why is the median often more useful than the mean for income data?"
    a: "Because a few extremely high incomes skew the mean upward. In the US, the mean household income is about $105,000 but the median is about $75,000. The median better represents what a 'typical' household earns because it isn't distorted by billionaires."
  - q: "When should I use the mode?"
    a: "Use the mode when you want to know the most common value. It's useful for categorical data (most popular shoe size, most common favorite color) and for identifying peaks in data distribution."
  - q: "Can a dataset have no mode?"
    a: "Yes. If every value appears the same number of times, there is no mode. A dataset can also have multiple modes — if two values are equally most frequent, it's called bimodal."
  - q: "What is a weighted average?"
    a: "A weighted average gives different importance to different values. Your GPA is a weighted average — a grade in a 4-credit class counts twice as much as a grade in a 2-credit class. Weighted averages are more accurate when not all data points are equally important."

If Bill Gates walks into a bar with 99 other people, the average person in that bar is a billionaire. Obviously, no one else actually got richer — but the mean income in the room just skyrocketed.

This classic example shows why understanding different types of averages matters. The wrong average can be actively misleading.

## The Three Averages

**Mean** is what most people think of as "the average." Add all values together, divide by the count. For test scores of 80, 85, 90, 92, 95: mean = 442 ÷ 5 = 88.4.

**Median** is the middle value when all numbers are sorted in order. For those same scores (80, 85, 90, 92, 95), the median is 90 — the value right in the center.

**Mode** is the most frequently occurring value. If the scores were 80, 85, 90, 90, 95, the mode is 90 because it appears twice.

## When Each Average Matters

**Use the mean when** data is evenly distributed without extreme outliers. Good for: test scores in a normal class, daily temperatures over a month, consistent sales data.

**Use the median when** data has outliers or is skewed. Good for: income and salary data, housing prices, response times (where a few very slow responses skew the mean).

**Use the mode when** you want the most common value. Good for: clothing sizes, survey responses, most popular choices.

## Real-World Examples

**Salary negotiation.** A company says the "average salary" for your role is $85,000. If that's the mean, it could be skewed by a few executives making $200,000+. Ask for the median instead — it's a more honest representation.

**Housing prices.** Your agent says the average home in the neighborhood sold for $500,000. If one mansion sold for $2 million, the mean is inflated. The median selling price is more useful for budgeting.

**Student grades.** A class with scores of 45, 50, 88, 90, 92, 95, 98 has a mean of 79.7 and a median of 90. The mean suggests the class is struggling, but the median shows most students are doing well — two very low scores are pulling the mean down.

**Product reviews.** A product with ratings of 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 has a mean of 3.86 stars. But the mode is 5 and the median is 5. Most people love it, but a couple hate it. The mean alone misses this bimodal pattern.

## Weighted Averages in Daily Life

Weighted averages appear more often than you realize. Your college GPA weights grades by credit hours. Consumer Price Index weights different categories by spending patterns. Even your credit score uses a weighted formula — payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of history (15%), new credit (10%), and credit mix (10%).

## The Standard Deviation Factor

Averages alone don't tell the full story. Two students with 85% averages could have very different profiles: Student A scored 84, 85, 85, 86, 85 (consistent) while Student B scored 60, 70, 95, 100, 100 (volatile).

Standard deviation measures this spread. Low standard deviation means scores cluster near the average. High standard deviation means wide variation.

## Calculate Any Average

Our free [Average Calculator](/average) computes the mean, and you can use it with our other tools to analyze data sets quickly. For weighted grades specifically, try our [Grade Calculator](/grade) or [GPA Calculator](/gpa).
