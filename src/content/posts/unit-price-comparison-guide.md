faq:
  - q: "What is unit price?"
    a: "Unit price is the cost per standard unit of measurement (per ounce, per pound, per count, etc.). It lets you compare products of different sizes on equal terms to find the better deal."
  - q: "Is buying in bulk always cheaper?"
    a: "Not always. While bulk sizes usually have a lower unit price, there are exceptions. Some stores also run sales on smaller sizes that beat the bulk price. Always check the unit price, not just the total price."
  - q: "Where can I find the unit price in stores?"
    a: "Most US grocery stores display the unit price on the shelf label, usually in smaller text below the item price. It typically shows price per ounce, per pound, or per count."
  - q: "How do I calculate unit price myself?"
    a: "Divide the total price by the total quantity. For example, a 32 oz bottle of juice for $3.84 has a unit price of $3.84 ÷ 32 = $0.12 per ounce."

You're standing in the cereal aisle staring at two boxes of the same brand. The 18 oz box is $4.29. The 24 oz box is $5.49. Which one is the better deal?

Your gut says the bigger box — but is it? This is where unit pricing saves you real money.

## What Is Unit Price?

Unit price is simply the cost per standard unit — per ounce, per pound, per item, per sheet, etc. It strips away the packaging differences and lets you compare apples to apples.

**Formula:** Unit Price = Total Price ÷ Total Quantity

**Back to our cereal example:**
- 18 oz box at $4.29 → $4.29 ÷ 18 = **$0.238 per ounce**
- 24 oz box at $5.49 → $5.49 ÷ 24 = **$0.229 per ounce**

The bigger box wins — but only by about a penny per ounce. That's $0.22 saved total. If the smaller box is more convenient or you won't finish the bigger one before it goes stale, the savings might not be worth it.

## When Bigger Isn't Cheaper

Here are real scenarios where the bulk price loses:

**Sale on the smaller size.** A 12-pack of soda at $5.99 ($0.50/can) vs. a 24-pack at $13.99 ($0.58/can). The smaller pack is actually cheaper per unit because it's on sale.

**Store brand vs. name brand.** A 16 oz name-brand ketchup at $3.49 ($0.218/oz) vs. a 32 oz store brand at $3.99 ($0.125/oz). The store brand is nearly half the unit price.

**Different stores.** The "bulk" price at one store may be higher than the regular price at a discount grocer.

## Products Where Unit Price Matters Most

Some categories have huge unit price variation:

**Paper products** — Toilet paper and paper towels vary wildly. Always compare price per sheet or per square foot, not per roll (rolls have different sizes).

**Cleaning supplies** — Concentrated vs. regular formulas make total price misleading.

**Beverages** — Bottled water, juice, and soda have massive per-ounce differences between sizes and brands.

**Snacks** — Family-size bags are usually cheaper per ounce, but individual servings at dollar stores can sometimes beat them.

**Pet food** — Larger bags almost always have a significantly lower unit price.

## How to Use Unit Price While Shopping

**Step 1:** Check the shelf label. Most US grocery stores are required to show unit price. Look for the small print that says "price per oz" or "price per count."

**Step 2:** Compare within the same unit. Make sure you're comparing ounce-to-ounce or count-to-count. A paper towel priced "per roll" can't be compared to one priced "per sheet."

**Step 3:** Factor in waste. A bulk package of fresh produce that goes bad before you eat it has an effective unit price of infinity on the wasted portion.

**Step 4:** Consider storage. Buying 48 rolls of toilet paper is great per-unit but only if you have somewhere to put it.

## How Much Can You Actually Save?

Studies suggest that consistent unit price comparison saves the average family $500-1,500 per year on groceries. That's real money — and it takes just seconds per item once you develop the habit.

The biggest savings come from three switches: store brands over name brands, optimal package sizes, and buying staples on sale.
