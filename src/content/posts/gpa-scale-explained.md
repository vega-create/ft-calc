faq:
  - q: "What is a good GPA for college admissions?"
    a: "A 3.5+ unweighted GPA is considered strong for most colleges. Top universities like Ivy League schools typically expect 3.8+ unweighted. However, GPA is just one factor — test scores, essays, and activities also matter."
  - q: "What's the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?"
    a: "Unweighted GPA uses a 4.0 scale for all classes. Weighted GPA gives extra points for honors (4.5 scale) and AP/IB courses (5.0 scale), so weighted GPAs can exceed 4.0."
  - q: "Can I raise my GPA senior year?"
    a: "Yes, but the impact depends on how many credits you've already earned. A senior with 90 credits raising one semester's grades from B to A only moves the cumulative GPA by about 0.05-0.1 points."
  - q: "Do colleges look at the overall GPA or each semester?"
    a: "Most colleges review both your cumulative GPA and your grade trends. An upward trend (improving grades over time) is viewed positively, even if your overall GPA isn't perfect."

Jessica had a 3.4 GPA and was convinced she couldn't get into a good college. Meanwhile, her friend Marcus had a 4.2 GPA. How is that even possible on a 4.0 scale? Understanding how GPA actually works — and what colleges really care about — can save you a lot of unnecessary stress.

## The 4.0 Scale

The standard unweighted GPA scale converts letter grades to numbers. An A equals 4.0, A- equals 3.7, B+ equals 3.3, B equals 3.0, B- equals 2.7, C+ equals 2.3, C equals 2.0, C- equals 1.7, D equals 1.0, and F equals 0.

To calculate your GPA, multiply each grade's point value by the course's credit hours, add everything up, then divide by total credit hours.

For example, if you earned an A (4.0) in a 4-credit course and a B (3.0) in a 3-credit course, your GPA would be: (4.0 × 4 + 3.0 × 3) ÷ 7 = 25 ÷ 7 = 3.57.

## Weighted vs. Unweighted

Weighted GPA rewards students for taking harder classes. Honors courses typically add 0.5 points and AP/IB courses add 1.0 point to each grade.

So a B in a regular class is 3.0, a B in honors is 3.5, and a B in AP is 4.0. An A in AP is 5.0 — which is how students can have GPAs above 4.0.

This means Marcus's 4.2 weighted GPA might actually reflect the same caliber of work as Jessica's 3.4, just with more AP classes on his schedule.

## What GPA Do You Need?

**Community colleges:** Generally accept all students regardless of GPA. A 2.0+ is standard.

**State universities:** Most require a 2.5-3.0 minimum, with competitive programs wanting 3.3+.

**Selective private colleges:** Typically expect 3.5+ unweighted, with many admitted students having 3.7-4.0.

**Ivy League and elite schools:** Average admitted GPA is 3.9+ unweighted, though they consider the rigor of your course load heavily.

**Graduate school:** Most programs require a 3.0 minimum, with competitive programs expecting 3.5+.

**Scholarships:** Many academic scholarships require a 3.0+ minimum, with the most generous awards going to 3.7+ students.

## How to Improve Your GPA

**Prioritize high-credit courses.** An A in a 4-credit class impacts your GPA twice as much as an A in a 2-credit class.

**Use grade replacement.** Many schools allow you to retake a course and replace the old grade. If you got a D in Chemistry, retaking for an A makes a huge difference.

**Don't neglect "easy" classes.** An A in an elective counts just as much as an A in your major for your cumulative GPA.

**Seek help early.** If you're struggling in a class, visit office hours in week 3, not week 14. Tutoring services are usually free at most schools.
