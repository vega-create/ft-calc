How old are you — really? Most people know their age in years, but can you say exactly how many months, weeks, or days you've been alive? And does it actually matter?

It turns out that knowing your precise age is more important than you might think — especially when it comes to legal rights, insurance, retirement planning, and medical milestones.

## Why Exact Age Matters

In the United States, many rights and benefits are tied to specific ages, and sometimes even specific dates. For example, you can't sign up for Medicare the moment you turn 64 and 11 months — you need to wait until you're actually 65, and the enrollment window is tied to your birth month.

Similarly, withdrawing from your 401(k) before age 59½ triggers a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Not 59, not 60 — specifically 59 and a half. That half-year distinction can save you thousands of dollars.

## Key US Age Milestones

**Age 16:** Driver's license in most states. Some states allow learner's permits at 15 or 15½.

**Age 18:** Legal adulthood. You can vote, join the military, sign contracts, and buy lottery tickets. You're also tried as an adult in criminal court.

**Age 21:** Legal drinking age nationwide. Also the minimum age to purchase handguns from licensed dealers in most states.

**Age 25:** Car insurance rates typically drop significantly. The brain's prefrontal cortex is considered fully developed.

**Age 26:** Last year you can stay on a parent's health insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act.

**Age 50:** Eligible for catch-up contributions to 401(k) ($7,500 extra per year) and IRA ($1,000 extra per year).

**Age 59½:** Can withdraw from 401(k) and traditional IRA without the 10% early withdrawal penalty.

**Age 62:** Earliest age to claim Social Security retirement benefits (at a reduced rate).

**Age 65:** Medicare eligibility begins. Enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period to avoid late penalties.

**Age 67:** Full Social Security retirement age for anyone born after 1960.

**Age 70:** Maximum Social Security benefit. Delaying past 67 increases your benefit by 8% per year up to age 70.

## Fun Age Facts

The average American has been alive for about 28,000 days by age 77. You've experienced roughly 27 leap years by age 108. And if you were born on February 29, you've technically only had a "real" birthday every four years — though legally you still age normally.

In South Korea, everyone traditionally turns one year older on New Year's Day, meaning a baby born on December 31 would be considered two years old the very next day. South Korea officially switched to the international age system in 2023.
