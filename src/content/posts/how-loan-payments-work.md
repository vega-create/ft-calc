  - q: "Why does most of my payment go to interest at the beginning?"
    a: "Interest is calculated on your remaining balance. When you first start paying, your balance is highest, so the interest portion is largest. As you pay down the principal, less goes to interest and more goes to principal."
  - q: "How much can I save by making extra payments?"
    a: "On a $250,000 30-year mortgage at 7%, paying an extra $200/month saves about $82,000 in interest and pays off the loan 7 years early."
  - q: "What's the difference between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage?"
    a: "A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but a lower interest rate and saves you a huge amount in total interest. A 30-year has lower monthly payments but costs much more overall."
  - q: "Should I pay off my loan early or invest the money?"
    a: "It depends on your interest rate. If your loan rate is higher than your expected investment return, pay off the loan. If your rate is low (under 4-5%), investing the extra money may yield better returns. But being debt-free also has psychological value."

You just signed a 30-year mortgage for $300,000 at 7% interest. Your monthly payment is $1,996. Over 30 years, you'll pay a total of $718,527 — more than double the original loan amount. Wait, what?

It sounds shocking, but that's exactly how amortization works. Understanding it is the key to making smarter borrowing decisions.

## What Is Amortization?

Amortization is the process of paying off a loan through regular, equal payments over a set period. Each payment is split between two things: interest (what the bank charges you for borrowing) and principal (reducing what you actually owe).

The twist is that the split changes over time. Early payments are mostly interest. Later payments are mostly principal.

## Why Early Payments Are Mostly Interest

Interest is calculated on your remaining balance. When you start a loan, your balance is at its maximum — so the interest charge is at its maximum too.

**Example — Month 1 of a $300,000 loan at 7%:**
- Monthly interest rate: 7% ÷ 12 = 0.583%
- Interest charge: $300,000 × 0.00583 = **$1,750**
- Your payment: $1,996
- Amount going to principal: $1,996 - $1,750 = **$246**

In the first month, 87.7% of your payment goes to interest. Only 12.3% reduces your debt.

**Fast forward to Month 300 (year 25):**
- Remaining balance: about $107,000
- Interest charge: $107,000 × 0.00583 = **$624**
- Amount going to principal: $1,996 - $624 = **$1,372**

Now 68.7% goes to principal. The balance shrinks faster and faster as you progress.

## The Total Cost of Borrowing

The interest rate determines how much extra you pay over the life of the loan.

For a **$300,000 mortgage:**

| Term | Rate | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 30 years | 6% | $1,799 | $347,515 |
| 30 years | 7% | $1,996 | $418,527 |
| 30 years | 8% | $2,201 | $492,476 |
| 15 years | 6% | $2,532 | $155,683 |
| 15 years | 7% | $2,696 | $185,367 |

A single percentage point difference on a 30-year mortgage costs roughly $70,000 in extra interest.

## How Extra Payments Save You Thousands

Making extra payments — even small ones — directly reduces your principal, which means less interest accrues in every future month. The effect snowballs.

**$300,000 mortgage at 7%, 30 years:**
- Normal payoff: 30 years, $418,527 in interest
- Extra $100/month: Paid off in 25.5 years, saves **$56,000** in interest
- Extra $200/month: Paid off in 22.5 years, saves **$98,000** in interest
- Extra $500/month: Paid off in 17.5 years, saves **$175,000** in interest

Even rounding up your payment to the nearest hundred can shave years off your loan.

## Amortization Applies to All Loans

The same principle works for car loans, student loans, and personal loans — any loan with fixed payments.

**Auto loan example:** A $35,000 car loan at 6.5% for 5 years has a monthly payment of $685. Total interest paid: $6,100. If you extend to 7 years, the payment drops to $520 but total interest rises to $8,700.

**Student loans:** Federal student loans typically have 10-year repayment terms. Extending to 25 years lowers payments but dramatically increases total interest.
