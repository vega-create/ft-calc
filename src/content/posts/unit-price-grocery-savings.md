  - q: "Where can I find the unit price at the grocery store?"
    a: "In most US grocery stores, the unit price is printed on the shelf price tag, usually in smaller text below the total price. It's often expressed as 'price per ounce,' 'price per count,' or 'price per 100ml.' If it's not shown, divide the total price by the quantity yourself."
  - q: "Is buying in bulk always cheaper per unit?"
    a: "Not always. Sales, coupons, and store promotions can make smaller sizes cheaper per unit. Always check the unit price rather than assuming bigger = better deal. Also consider waste — buying 5 pounds of lettuce saves nothing if half of it rots."
  - q: "Does brand vs generic make a big price difference?"
    a: "Generic and store-brand products are typically 20-40% cheaper than name brands. For staples like flour, sugar, salt, and canned goods, the quality is often identical since many generics are made in the same factories as name brands."
  - q: "How much can I save by comparing unit prices?"
    a: "Studies show that consistent unit price comparison saves the average family $500-$1,500 per year on groceries. The savings are largest on frequently purchased items like cereal, snacks, beverages, and cleaning supplies."

Two bottles of ketchup. One is 20 oz for $3.49. The other is 32 oz for $4.99. Which is the better deal?

Most people grab the bigger bottle assuming it's cheaper. But let's check: the 20 oz bottle is $0.175 per ounce, while the 32 oz bottle is $0.156 per ounce. The bigger bottle wins — but only by about 2 cents per ounce.

Now add a wrinkle: the 20 oz bottle has a "buy one get one 50% off" promotion. With the deal, two 20 oz bottles (40 oz total) cost $5.24, or $0.131 per ounce — significantly cheaper than the single 32 oz bottle.

This is why unit price matters. The deal that looks obvious often isn't.

## How to Calculate Unit Price

The formula is simple: Unit Price = Total Price ÷ Total Quantity.

$4.99 for 32 oz: $4.99 ÷ 32 = $0.156 per ounce. $7.99 for 64 oz: $7.99 ÷ 64 = $0.125 per ounce. $2.99 for 12 oz: $2.99 ÷ 12 = $0.249 per ounce.

The lowest unit price is the best value, assuming you'll actually use the full amount before it expires.

## Common Shopping Traps

**The "family size" assumption.** Family and bulk sizes are usually cheaper per unit, but not always. During sales, regular sizes with promotions frequently beat bulk prices. Check every time.

**Different unit measurements.** One brand lists price per ounce, another lists price per 100 grams. You can't compare directly without converting. Our [Unit Price Calculator](/unit-price) handles this automatically.

**Ignoring expiration dates.** A gallon of milk at $0.04/oz beats a half gallon at $0.05/oz — unless you can't drink a full gallon before it spoils. The "savings" disappear if you throw away 30% of the product.

**Multi-buy deals.** "3 for $10" sounds great, but if the regular price is $3.49 each, you're only saving $0.49 total — and you might not need three. Worse, some stores set the "3 for $10" price at exactly $3.33 each, meaning there's no savings at all.

## Where Unit Price Saves the Most

The biggest savings come from items you buy frequently. Even small per-unit differences add up dramatically over a year.

**Cereal:** Premium brands can cost $0.35/oz while store brands run $0.15/oz. On 2 boxes per month, switching saves about $60/year.

**Beverages:** Single bottles cost $0.05-$0.10/oz while multi-packs run $0.02-$0.04/oz. A family drinking 5 bottles per week saves $100+/year.

**Cleaning supplies:** Concentrated formulas at $0.10/oz dilute to effectively $0.02/oz, while ready-to-use versions cost $0.06/oz. Smart concentrate buying saves $30-$50/year.

**Paper products:** Toilet paper ranges from $0.03 to $0.08 per square foot depending on brand, size, and deals. Consistent unit price shopping saves $40-$70/year.

## The Costco Question

Is a warehouse membership worth it? The math depends on what you buy.

For non-perishable staples, cleaning supplies, and paper products, Costco's unit prices are typically 20-40% below grocery stores. For a family spending $200/month on these categories, the savings easily cover the $65 annual membership.

But warehouse shopping has traps: impulse purchases on items you wouldn't normally buy, perishable bulk food that goes to waste, and the $1.50 hot dog combo that somehow turns every trip into a $300 expedition.
