  - q: "What is a healthy BMI range?"
    a: "A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally considered normal weight. Below 18.5 is underweight, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30+ is classified as obese."
  - q: "Is BMI accurate for muscular people?"
    a: "No. BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat. Athletes and bodybuilders often have high BMIs despite being very fit. Body fat percentage is a better metric for them."
  - q: "How is BMI calculated?"
    a: "BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height (m)². In pounds and inches: BMI = (weight × 703) ÷ (height in inches)²."
  - q: "Should I use BMI to set health goals?"
    a: "BMI is a useful screening tool, but shouldn't be the only metric you track. Waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and bloodwork give a much fuller picture of health."

You step on the scale at your annual checkup. The nurse types in your height and weight, and a moment later tells you your BMI is 27.3. "That puts you in the overweight category," she says. You leave feeling confused — you exercise regularly and feel healthy. What does this number actually mean?

BMI is one of the most widely used health metrics in the world. It's also one of the most misunderstood. Here's what you need to know.

## What Is BMI?

BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It's a simple calculation that uses your height and weight to estimate whether you're at a healthy weight.

**BMI Formula (metric):** BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²

**BMI Formula (imperial):** BMI = (Weight in pounds × 703) ÷ (Height in inches)²

**Example:** A person who is 5'9" (69 inches) and weighs 170 lbs:
- (170 × 703) ÷ (69)² = 119,510 ÷ 4,761 = **25.1**

## BMI Categories

The World Health Organization classifies BMI into these ranges:

- **Under 18.5** — Underweight
- **18.5 to 24.9** — Normal weight
- **25.0 to 29.9** — Overweight
- **30.0 to 34.9** — Obese (Class 1)
- **35.0 to 39.9** — Obese (Class 2)
- **40.0 and above** — Obese (Class 3)

These ranges were developed based on large population studies linking BMI to health risks like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

## What BMI Gets Right

BMI works well as a quick population-level screening tool. For most people who aren't athletes or bodybuilders, a higher BMI does correlate with increased health risks.

It's cheap, easy, and requires no special equipment — just a scale and a measuring tape. That's why doctors use it as a starting point during checkups.

## Where BMI Falls Short

BMI has some significant blind spots.

**It can't tell muscle from fat.** A 6'0" football player weighing 220 lbs of mostly muscle has a BMI of 29.8 — technically "overweight." Meanwhile, someone with very little muscle mass could have a "normal" BMI but carry excess body fat.

**It doesn't account for body composition.** Two people can have the same BMI but very different body fat percentages, fitness levels, and health outcomes.

**It doesn't consider age, sex, or ethnicity.** Health risks associated with the same BMI differ across demographic groups. Some researchers have proposed adjusted BMI ranges for different populations.

**It ignores fat distribution.** Belly fat (visceral fat) is much more dangerous than fat stored in hips and thighs. BMI can't tell the difference.

## Better Metrics to Track Alongside BMI

For a fuller picture of health, consider these measurements:

**Waist circumference** — A waist over 40 inches (men) or 35 inches (women) signals higher risk, regardless of BMI.

**Body fat percentage** — Our [body fat calculator](/body-fat/) gives a more accurate picture than BMI alone. Healthy ranges are roughly 10-20% for men and 18-28% for women.

**Waist-to-hip ratio** — Dividing your waist measurement by your hip measurement. A ratio above 0.90 (men) or 0.85 (women) indicates higher health risk.

## How to Use BMI Wisely

Think of BMI as one data point — not a verdict. If your BMI is in the normal range and you feel good, great. If it's outside that range, it's worth having a deeper conversation with your doctor about your overall health picture.

The most important thing isn't a number on a chart. It's whether you're eating well, moving regularly, sleeping enough, and managing stress.
