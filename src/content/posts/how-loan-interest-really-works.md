  - q: "What's the difference between interest rate and APR?"
    a: "The interest rate is the base cost of borrowing. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) includes the interest rate PLUS fees, points, and other charges. APR is always equal to or higher than the interest rate, and it's the better number for comparing loans."
  - q: "Why does most of my payment go to interest at first?"
    a: "Because interest is calculated on the remaining balance. In the beginning, your balance is highest, so interest charges are largest. As you pay down the principal, more of each payment goes toward the actual balance. This is called amortization."
  - q: "Is it better to pay extra toward principal or make extra payments?"
    a: "Both help, but paying extra toward principal is slightly more efficient because it directly reduces the balance that interest is calculated on. Always specify that extra payments should be applied to principal, not toward future payments."
  - q: "What is a good interest rate for a personal loan?"
    a: "For borrowers with excellent credit (720+), rates of 6-10% are competitive in 2026. Good credit (680-719) typically sees 10-15%. Fair credit (640-679) may face 15-25%. Below 640, rates can exceed 25%, and you should explore alternatives."

You borrow $20,000 for a car at 6% interest over 5 years. Your monthly payment is $387. Seems reasonable, right? But by the end of the loan, you'll have paid $23,199 — over $3,000 more than you borrowed.

That extra $3,199 is the true cost of borrowing, and most people never think about it when signing loan papers. Understanding how interest works puts you in control.

## How Interest Is Calculated

Most loans use simple interest on the remaining balance. Each month, the bank calculates: Monthly Interest = Remaining Balance × (Annual Rate ÷ 12).

On a $20,000 loan at 6%: first month's interest is $20,000 × (0.06 ÷ 12) = $100. Your $387 payment covers that $100 in interest, and the remaining $287 reduces your principal to $19,713.

Next month, interest is calculated on $19,713 instead of $20,000: $19,713 × 0.005 = $98.57. So $288.43 goes to principal. Each month, more money goes to principal and less to interest.

## The Amortization Schedule

This gradual shift from interest-heavy to principal-heavy payments is called amortization. On a 30-year mortgage, the shift is dramatic.

On a $300,000 mortgage at 7%, your first payment of $1,996 breaks down as $1,750 in interest and only $246 in principal. After 15 years of payments (halfway through the loan), you've paid about $359,000 but still owe $234,000 — you've only reduced your balance by $66,000.

This is why early extra payments are so powerful. An extra $200/month in the first year saves far more total interest than $200/month in year 25.

## APR vs. Interest Rate

The interest rate is the base cost. APR includes origination fees, closing costs, discount points, and other charges, spread over the loan's life.

A mortgage might have a 6.5% interest rate but a 6.8% APR after fees. A personal loan might advertise 8% interest but have a 12% APR after the 3% origination fee.

Always compare loans using APR, not the advertised interest rate. It's the only honest apples-to-apples comparison.

## Fixed vs. Variable Rates

**Fixed rate** stays the same for the entire loan term. Your payment is predictable, which makes budgeting easy. Best when interest rates are low or you want certainty.

**Variable rate** (adjustable rate) starts lower but can change based on market conditions. An ARM mortgage might start at 5.5% but could rise to 8%+ after the initial fixed period.

Variable rates are riskier but can save money if rates drop or if you plan to pay off the loan quickly.

## Strategies to Pay Less Interest

**Make biweekly payments.** Instead of 12 monthly payments, make 26 half-payments per year. This sneaks in one extra full payment annually, which on a 30-year mortgage can save 4-6 years and tens of thousands in interest.

**Round up payments.** If your payment is $387, pay $400. That extra $13/month on a $20,000 car loan saves about $200 in interest and pays off the loan 3 months early.

**Refinance when rates drop.** If rates fall 0.75-1% below your current rate, refinancing often makes sense. Run the numbers to ensure savings exceed closing costs.

**Attack highest-rate debt first.** If you have multiple loans, the "avalanche method" — paying extra toward the highest interest rate loan — minimizes total interest paid.

## Run the Numbers

Use our free [Loan Calculator](/loan) to see exactly how much interest you'll pay over any loan term, and experiment with extra payments to see how much you can save. Our [Compound Interest Calculator](/compound-interest) shows the flip side — how that same money grows when invested instead of going to loan interest.
