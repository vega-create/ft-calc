  - q: "How do I calculate my grade if assignments have different weights?"
    a: "Multiply each assignment grade by its weight (as a decimal), then add them all up. For example: Homework (30% weight) with 90% score = 0.30 × 90 = 27. Midterm (30%) with 85% = 25.5. Final (40%) with ? = your target."
  - q: "Is it possible to pass a class if I failed the midterm?"
    a: "Usually yes, depending on the grading weights. If the midterm is 25% and you got a 50%, you'd need roughly 83% on remaining work (if weighted 75%) to reach a 75% overall. Use our calculator to check your specific situation."
  - q: "Do professors curve final grades?"
    a: "Some do, some don't. Curving adjusts grades relative to class performance. A common method adds enough points so the class average hits a target (often a B or B-). Check your syllabus or ask your professor."
  - q: "What happens if I don't take the final?"
    a: "A missed final typically counts as a zero, which devastates your grade since finals are usually weighted 20-40% of your total grade. A zero on a 30%-weighted final drops an otherwise 90% student to a 63% — from an A to a D."

It's Week 12. You've gotten an 88 on the midterm, averaged 75 on homework, and scored 92 on the paper. Your final exam is worth 40% of the grade. Can you still get an A? And what's the minimum score you need to keep a B?

These are the questions every student asks at the end of the semester. Here's how to answer them.

## How Weighted Grades Work

Most college courses use weighted grading, where different assignments count for different percentages of your final grade. A typical breakdown might look like homework 20%, midterm 20%, paper 20%, and final exam 40%.

To calculate your current grade, multiply each component's grade by its weight. Using the example above: Homework (20%): 75 × 0.20 = 15. Midterm (20%): 88 × 0.20 = 17.6. Paper (20%): 92 × 0.20 = 18.4. Your accumulated grade so far: 15 + 17.6 + 18.4 = 51 out of 60 possible points (since 60% of the course is complete).

Your current average: 51 ÷ 60 = 85% (a B).

## What Score Do You Need on the Final?

The formula is: Final Score Needed = (Target Grade - Current Accumulated Points) ÷ Final Exam Weight.

To get an A (90% overall): (90 - 51) ÷ 0.40 = 97.5%. You'd need a 97.5% on the final. Tough but possible.

To keep a B (80% overall): (80 - 51) ÷ 0.40 = 72.5%. A 72.5% on the final keeps you at a B. Very achievable.

To pass with a C (70% overall): (70 - 51) ÷ 0.40 = 47.5%. Even scoring below 50% on the final still passes the class.

## The Drop-Lowest Policy

Many professors drop your lowest homework or quiz score. This can significantly boost your grade. If you have 10 homework assignments and the lowest is dropped, your homework average is calculated from the best 9.

If your scores were 60, 75, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95, 100 — dropping the 60 raises your homework average from 84.7% to 87.4%.

## Extra Credit Math

Extra credit typically adds points directly to a category. If your midterm was 88/100 and the professor offers 5 points extra credit, your midterm becomes 93/100. At 20% weight, those 5 points are worth 1 full percentage point on your final grade (5 × 0.20 = 1.0).

Always do extra credit. Even small amounts compound across a semester.

## Study Strategy Based on Math

If your final is worth 40% and you currently have an 85%, here's a strategic reality check.

Studying to improve from a B+ to an A requires scoring 97%+ on the final. That's a huge investment with uncertain returns.

Alternatively, if you're borderline passing, the math might show that the final can't mathematically save you — in which case, talking to your professor about options (incomplete, withdrawal, extra credit) is a better use of your time.
