faq:
  - q: "How do I convert my salary to an hourly rate?"
    a: "Divide your annual salary by 2,080 (52 weeks × 40 hours). A $60,000 salary equals $28.85 per hour."
  - q: "Is a $50,000 salary good?"
    a: "It depends on where you live. $50,000 is comfortable in lower-cost areas like the Midwest but tight in expensive cities like San Francisco or New York. It equals about $24/hour before taxes."
  - q: "How do I compare a salary job to an hourly job?"
    a: "Convert both to the same unit. For hourly jobs, factor in overtime potential and whether benefits like health insurance are included. A $25/hour job with benefits might be worth more than a $60,000 salary without them."
  - q: "What is a good hourly rate for freelancers?"
    a: "Freelancers should charge 25-50% more than an equivalent employee hourly rate to cover self-employment tax, health insurance, no paid time off, and business expenses. If a job pays $30/hour as an employee, freelancers should charge $38-45/hour."

Your offer letter says $72,000 per year. Your friend's contract says $38 an hour. Who makes more? It's not as obvious as it seems — and knowing how to convert between the two is essential for making smart career decisions.

## The Basic Formula

**Hourly Rate = Annual Salary ÷ 2,080**

Where does 2,080 come from? That's 52 weeks × 40 hours per week — the standard full-time work year in the US.

**Common salary-to-hourly conversions:**

| Annual Salary | Hourly Rate | Monthly Take-Home (est.) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $35,000 | $16.83 | ~$2,400 |
| $45,000 | $21.63 | ~$3,000 |
| $55,000 | $26.44 | ~$3,600 |
| $65,000 | $31.25 | ~$4,200 |
| $75,000 | $36.06 | ~$4,800 |
| $85,000 | $40.87 | ~$5,400 |
| $100,000 | $48.08 | ~$6,200 |

*Monthly take-home estimates assume roughly 25-30% combined federal, state, and payroll taxes.*

## The Quick Mental Math Trick

**To estimate your hourly rate from salary:** Drop the last three zeros and divide by 2.

- $60,000 → 60 ÷ 2 = **~$30/hour** (actual: $28.85)
- $80,000 → 80 ÷ 2 = **~$40/hour** (actual: $38.46)
- $100,000 → 100 ÷ 2 = **~$50/hour** (actual: $48.08)

It's not exact, but it gets you close enough for quick comparisons.

**To estimate salary from hourly rate:** Double the rate and add three zeros.

- $25/hour → 25 × 2 = **~$50,000/year** (actual: $52,000)
- $35/hour → 35 × 2 = **~$70,000/year** (actual: $72,800)

## Your Real Hourly Rate (The Honest Version)

The formula above assumes you work exactly 40 hours a week. But many salaried employees work more. If you regularly put in 50-hour weeks, your effective hourly rate drops significantly.

**$75,000 salary at different weekly hours:**
- 40 hours/week: $36.06/hour
- 45 hours/week: $32.05/hour
- 50 hours/week: $28.85/hour
- 55 hours/week: $26.22/hour
- 60 hours/week: $24.04/hour

A salaried employee working 60-hour weeks at $75,000 makes less per hour than someone earning $25/hour at 40 hours.

## Comparing Job Offers: Beyond the Number

When evaluating offers, salary or hourly rate is just one piece. Consider:

**Health insurance** — Employer-provided health coverage is worth $6,000-$20,000/year. An hourly job without benefits might actually pay less when you factor in buying your own insurance.

**Retirement match** — A 5% 401(k) match on a $70,000 salary adds $3,500/year in free money.

**Paid time off** — Two weeks of PTO on a salaried job means you're still paid for 52 weeks of work. An hourly worker taking two weeks off loses two weeks of pay.

**Overtime** — Hourly workers often earn 1.5× their rate for overtime hours. If you consistently work 50+ hours, an hourly position might earn more than a comparable salary.

## Freelancer Rate Calculation

If you're freelancing or consulting, your rate needs to be higher than an employee rate to cover:

- Self-employment tax (~15.3%)
- Health insurance ($300-800/month)
- No paid vacation or sick days
- Business expenses
- Unpaid time spent on admin, marketing, invoicing

**Rule of thumb:** Multiply the employee hourly rate by 1.3-1.5 to get a freelance rate.

An employee making $40/hour should freelance at $52-60/hour to have equivalent take-home pay.
