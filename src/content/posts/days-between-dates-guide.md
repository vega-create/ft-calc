faq:
  - q: "How many days are in a year?"
    a: "A regular year has 365 days. A leap year has 366 days. Leap years occur every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100 (unless also divisible by 400). So 2024 was a leap year, but 2100 won't be."
  - q: "How do I count business days between two dates?"
    a: "Count all weekdays (Monday through Friday) between the two dates, excluding weekends. For a more accurate count, also remove federal holidays. Our Date Difference Calculator can help with this."
  - q: "Is there a quick way to count months between dates?"
    a: "Count the number of full months between the dates, then handle the remaining days separately. For example, January 15 to April 10 is 2 full months (Feb 15 to Mar 15 to Apr 15 would be 3, but we stop at Apr 10) — so it's 2 months and 26 days."
  - q: "What is an epoch date?"
    a: "In computing, the epoch is January 1, 1970 (Unix time). Computers track dates as seconds since this point. As of 2026, we're at about 1.77 billion seconds since the epoch."

How many days until your vacation? How many weeks along is the pregnancy? How many business days until the project deadline? How old is your lease in months?

Date calculations seem simple until you actually try to do them by hand. Months have different lengths, leap years sneak in, and counting across year boundaries gets messy fast.

## The Challenge of Date Math

Unlike regular math where 1 + 1 always equals 2, date math is irregular. January has 31 days, February has 28 (or 29), and April has 30. Counting from January 28 to March 5 means crossing through February — which could be 28 or 29 days depending on the year.

This irregularity is why so many people get date calculations wrong, and why calculators are genuinely helpful here.

## Common Date Calculations

**Days until an event.** Planning a wedding for September 20? You need to know exactly how many days you have left to prepare. From today (February 2026), that's roughly 225 days — or about 32 weeks.

**Pregnancy due dates.** The standard pregnancy is 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of the last menstrual period. Knowing the exact day count helps track trimester transitions and schedule appointments.

**Lease and contract terms.** A 12-month lease signed on March 15 doesn't expire on March 15 of the next year — it typically expires on March 14. Understanding whether terms are calculated by calendar months or by days matters for legal purposes.

**Project timelines.** Agile sprints, construction schedules, and academic semesters all depend on accurate day counts. Missing a deadline by one day because you forgot February was short is an avoidable mistake.

**Age verification.** As we discussed in our [age milestones guide](/blog/age-milestones-guide), precise day counting matters for legal thresholds like turning 21 or becoming eligible for Medicare.

## Business Days vs. Calendar Days

A common source of confusion is the difference between calendar days and business days.

Calendar days include every day — weekends and holidays included. If a contract says "30 calendar days," you count Saturday, Sunday, and Christmas just like any other day.

Business days (or working days) only count Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. "30 business days" is actually about 6 calendar weeks (42 days), since each week only has 5 business days.

This distinction matters enormously for shipping estimates, legal deadlines, government processing times, and payment terms. "Net 30" in business typically means 30 calendar days, but some industries use business days.

## US Federal Holidays (2026)

When calculating business days, these 11 federal holidays are excluded: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

Some industries also observe additional holidays or half-days, like the day after Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve.
