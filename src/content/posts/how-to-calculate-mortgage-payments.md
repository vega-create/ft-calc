  - q: "What is included in a monthly mortgage payment?"
    a: "A typical mortgage payment includes four parts: principal (paying down the loan balance), interest (the cost of borrowing), property taxes, and homeowners insurance. This is often called PITI."
  - q: "How much house can I afford on a $60,000 salary?"
    a: "A common rule is spending no more than 28% of gross income on housing. On $60,000, that's about $1,400/month for your mortgage payment including taxes and insurance."
  - q: "Does a longer loan term mean lower payments?"
    a: "Yes, a 30-year mortgage has lower monthly payments than a 15-year mortgage. However, you'll pay significantly more total interest over the life of the longer loan."
  - q: "Should I make extra payments on my mortgage?"
    a: "Extra payments reduce your principal faster, saving thousands in interest over time. Even one additional payment per year can shave years off a 30-year mortgage."

Sarah and her husband found the perfect house listed at $350,000. The real estate agent told them to "just run the numbers," but neither of them had any idea how mortgage math actually works. If you've ever stared at a listing price wondering what your actual monthly payment would be, you're not alone.

Understanding mortgage calculations doesn't require a finance degree — just a few key concepts and a good calculator.

## What Makes Up a Mortgage Payment

Your monthly mortgage payment has four components, known as PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance.

**Principal** is the portion that actually pays down your loan balance. In the early years of a mortgage, this is surprisingly small — most of your payment goes toward interest.

**Interest** is what the bank charges you for borrowing money. On a $300,000 loan at 7%, you'd pay roughly $21,000 in interest during just the first year.

**Property taxes** vary by location but typically run between 0.5% and 2.5% of your home's value annually. A $350,000 home in Texas might have $8,750 in annual property taxes, while the same home in Hawaii might only owe $1,225.

**Homeowners insurance** protects your property and usually costs $1,000 to $3,000 per year depending on coverage and location.

## The Mortgage Payment Formula

The core formula for calculating monthly principal and interest is:

**M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n – 1]**

Where M is your monthly payment, P is the loan principal, r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12), and n is the total number of payments.

For a $280,000 loan (after a 20% down payment on $350,000) at 7% interest over 30 years: the monthly principal and interest payment comes to approximately $1,863.

Add roughly $400 for taxes and $150 for insurance, and the total monthly payment is around $2,413.

## How Down Payment Affects Your Payment

The down payment directly reduces your loan amount and can eliminate private mortgage insurance (PMI). Here's how different down payments affect a $350,000 home at 7% interest:

A 5% down payment ($17,500) means borrowing $332,500, resulting in roughly $2,212 monthly for principal and interest, plus PMI of about $140/month.

A 10% down payment ($35,000) reduces the loan to $315,000, dropping the payment to about $2,096 plus PMI of around $105/month.

A 20% down payment ($70,000) brings the loan to $280,000 and a payment of $1,863 — with no PMI required.

## 15-Year vs. 30-Year Comparison

A shorter loan term means higher monthly payments but dramatically less total interest. On a $280,000 loan at 7%:

The 30-year option gives you a $1,863 monthly payment but you'll pay $390,680 in total interest over the life of the loan.

The 15-year option bumps the payment to $2,517 monthly, but total interest drops to $173,060 — saving you over $217,000.

## Smart Strategies for Lower Payments

**Improve your credit score** before applying. Going from a 670 to a 740 score could save you 0.5% on your rate, which on a $280,000 loan saves roughly $100/month.

**Shop multiple lenders.** Rates can vary by 0.25% to 0.75% between lenders on the same day. Always get at least three quotes.

**Consider buying points.** Paying 1% of your loan amount upfront can reduce your rate by about 0.25%. This makes sense if you plan to stay in the home for 5+ years.

**Look into first-time buyer programs.** Many states offer down payment assistance or reduced-rate mortgages for qualified buyers.
