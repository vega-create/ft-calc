faq:
  - q: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?"
    a: "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal. Compound interest is calculated on the principal plus all previously earned interest — meaning your interest earns interest, creating exponential growth."
  - q: "How often should interest compound for best results?"
    a: "More frequent compounding means faster growth. Daily compounding beats monthly, which beats quarterly, which beats annually. Most savings accounts compound daily, while many investments compound monthly or quarterly."
  - q: "Is compound interest only for savings accounts?"
    a: "No. Compound interest applies to any investment that reinvests returns — stocks (via dividend reinvestment), bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and retirement accounts all benefit from compounding."
  - q: "Can compound interest work against me?"
    a: "Yes. Credit card debt and loans also compound. A $5,000 credit card balance at 24% APR grows to over $8,900 in just 3 years if you only make minimum payments."

Here's a mind-bending fact: if you invested just $100 per month starting at age 25 with a 10% average annual return, you'd have over $1.1 million by age 65. Wait until 35 to start the same investment, and you'd end up with only about $395,000. That 10-year delay cost you over $700,000 — even though you only missed $12,000 in actual contributions.

This is the magic of compound interest, and understanding it is the single most important financial concept you'll ever learn.

## How Compound Interest Works

Simple interest pays you only on your original deposit. If you invest $1,000 at 10% simple interest, you earn $100 every year — forever.

Compound interest pays you on your original deposit plus all the interest you've already earned. That same $1,000 at 10% compound interest earns $100 the first year, $110 the second year, $121 the third year, and keeps accelerating.

After 30 years, that $1,000 with simple interest would be worth $4,000. With compound interest, it would be worth $17,449. Same starting amount, same interest rate — but compounding produced more than four times the result.

## The Rule of 72

Want a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money? Divide 72 by your interest rate.

At 6% return, your money doubles every 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12). At 8%, it doubles every 9 years. At 10%, every 7.2 years. At 12%, every 6 years.

This means $10,000 invested at 10% becomes $20,000 in about 7 years, $40,000 in 14 years, $80,000 in 21 years, and $160,000 in 28 years — without adding a single extra dollar.

## Real-World Scenarios

**The early starter:** Investing $200/month from age 22 to 65 at 8% average return gives you approximately $945,000. Total invested: $103,200. Interest earned: $841,800.

**The late starter:** Investing $400/month from age 35 to 65 at 8% gives you approximately $589,000. Total invested: $144,000. Interest earned: $445,000.

The early starter invested less money but ended up with 60% more, because those extra 13 years of compounding made an enormous difference.

**The coffee trade:** Skipping a $5 daily coffee and investing it instead ($150/month) from age 25 to 65 at 9% average return produces about $884,000. Your lattes literally cost you nearly a million dollars.

## How to Maximize Compound Interest

**Start immediately.** The single most important factor is time. Even $50/month is better than waiting until you can afford $500/month.

**Reinvest everything.** If your investments pay dividends, reinvest them automatically. Every dollar reinvested starts compounding on its own.

**Increase contributions over time.** If you get a 3% raise, put at least 1% of it toward your investments. You won't miss it, but your future self will thank you.

**Minimize fees.** A 1% management fee might sound small, but over 30 years it can eat 25–30% of your total returns. Choose low-cost index funds when possible.

## The Dark Side of Compounding

Compound interest works against you with debt. A $10,000 credit card balance at 22% APR with minimum payments takes over 30 years to pay off and costs over $23,000 in interest — more than double the original balance.

This is why paying off high-interest debt should always be your first priority before investing.
