faq:
  - q: "Are computer-generated random numbers truly random?"
    a: "Most computer random numbers are 'pseudo-random' — they use mathematical algorithms that produce numbers that appear random but are actually deterministic. For everyday purposes, they're random enough."
  - q: "What's the difference between random and pseudo-random?"
    a: "True random numbers come from unpredictable physical phenomena like atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. Pseudo-random numbers are generated by algorithms — they're predictable if you know the seed value, but appear random in practice."
  - q: "Can random number generators be rigged?"
    a: "Pseudo-random generators can theoretically be predicted if someone knows the algorithm and seed. That's why casinos and lotteries use hardware-based true random generators or heavily audited systems."
  - q: "What is a seed in random number generation?"
    a: "A seed is the starting value that initializes a pseudo-random number generator. The same seed always produces the same sequence of numbers, which is useful for reproducing results in scientific research."

You need to pick a random number between 1 and 100. Quick — what's the first number that comes to mind? If you said 37 or 73, you're not alone. Humans are terrible at being random. We gravitate toward odd numbers, avoid patterns, and unconsciously favor certain digits.

That's why we need random number generators — and they're far more important than you might think.

## How Random Number Generators Work

There are two main types of random number generators: true random and pseudo-random.

**True random number generators (TRNG)** harvest randomness from physical phenomena. Random.org, for example, uses atmospheric noise. Other systems use radioactive decay, thermal noise in electronic circuits, or even lava lamps (Cloudflare famously uses a wall of lava lamps to generate encryption keys).

**Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG)** use mathematical algorithms. They start with a "seed" value and apply a formula to produce a sequence of numbers that appears random. The most common algorithm is the Mersenne Twister, which has a period of 2^19937-1 — meaning it generates that many numbers before the sequence repeats.

For almost every everyday purpose, pseudo-random is perfectly fine. You don't need quantum physics to decide who does the dishes tonight.

## Everyday Uses for Random Numbers

**Settling decisions.** Can't agree on where to eat? Generate a random number to pick from your list. It's faster than arguing for 30 minutes and ending up at the same place anyway.

**Games and activities.** Board games, classroom activities, raffle drawings, and team assignments all benefit from unbiased random selection.

**Statistics and research.** Random sampling is fundamental to valid research. If you're surveying 100 people from a list of 10,000, random selection prevents bias.

**Security.** Encryption keys, password generation, and authentication tokens all depend on randomness. The more unpredictable, the more secure.

**Creative projects.** Writers use random prompts to break through creative blocks. Musicians use random note generators for inspiration. Artists use randomized color palettes.

## The Gambler's Fallacy

One of the most common mistakes with randomness is the gambler's fallacy — the belief that past outcomes influence future random events.

If a fair coin lands heads five times in a row, many people feel that tails is "due." It's not. The probability of tails on the sixth flip is still exactly 50%. The coin has no memory.

This fallacy costs gamblers billions of dollars every year. In 1913, at the Monte Carlo Casino, the roulette ball landed on black 26 times in a row. Gamblers lost millions betting on red, convinced it had to come up next. The probability of 26 blacks in a row is about 1 in 67 million — rare, but not impossible, and each spin was still independent.

## Fair Random Selection Tips

When using random numbers for group decisions, transparency matters. Generate the number where everyone can see the result. Agree on the rules before generating. And use a tool rather than asking someone to "pick a number" — human-chosen numbers are never truly random.
