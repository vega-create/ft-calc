  - q: "How do I convert salary to hourly?"
    a: "Divide your annual salary by 2,080 (52 weeks × 40 hours). A $60,000 salary equals about $28.85/hour. For a quick estimate, drop the last three zeros and divide by 2: $60 ÷ 2 = $30/hour (close enough for mental math)."
  - q: "Is $20 an hour a good wage?"
    a: "$20/hour equals about $41,600/year before taxes. Whether it's 'good' depends on your location. In rural areas with low cost of living, it's comfortable. In expensive cities like San Francisco or New York, it's challenging to live on without roommates."
  - q: "Do salaried employees get paid for overtime?"
    a: "It depends on your classification. 'Non-exempt' salaried employees must receive overtime pay (1.5x for hours over 40/week). 'Exempt' employees — typically those earning above $43,888/year in professional roles — generally don't receive overtime pay."
  - q: "What is the federal minimum wage in 2026?"
    a: "The federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour, unchanged since 2009. However, most states have higher minimums. As of 2026, Washington state leads at over $16/hour, and many cities have local minimums above $18/hour."

"We're offering $55,000 a year." Sounds decent, but is it? When you break it down to an hourly rate and compare it against your living costs, the picture might look very different.

Conversely, if you're hourly at $22/hour, what does that actually translate to as an annual income? Knowing how to convert between salary and hourly pay is essential for evaluating job offers, negotiating raises, and understanding your real earning power.

## The Basic Conversion

**Annual salary to hourly rate:** Divide by 2,080 (52 weeks × 40 hours per week). $50,000 ÷ 2,080 = $24.04/hour. $75,000 ÷ 2,080 = $36.06/hour. $100,000 ÷ 2,080 = $48.08/hour.

**Hourly rate to annual salary:** Multiply by 2,080. $15/hour × 2,080 = $31,200/year. $25/hour × 2,080 = $52,000/year. $40/hour × 2,080 = $83,200/year.

**The quick mental shortcut:** For salary to hourly, drop the last three zeros and divide by 2. For $70,000: 70 ÷ 2 = $35/hour (actual: $33.65 — close enough).

## What About Taxes?

Your salary is gross pay — before taxes. Your actual take-home (net pay) is significantly less.

On a $60,000 salary, a single filer with no special deductions takes home roughly $47,000-$50,000 after federal income tax, Social Security (6.2%), Medicare (1.45%), and state income tax (varies by state).

That means your real hourly rate isn't $28.85 — it's more like $22.60-$24.00 after taxes.

States with no income tax (Texas, Florida, Washington, Nevada, Tennessee, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, New Hampshire) effectively give you a 3-10% raise compared to high-tax states like California or New York.

## The Hidden Value of Benefits

When comparing a salaried position to freelance or contract work, factor in employer-provided benefits. Typical benefit values include health insurance ($5,000-$15,000/year for employer's share), 401(k) match ($1,500-$6,000/year), paid time off ($3,000-$8,000 value for 15-20 days), and other benefits like dental, vision, and life insurance.

A $70,000 salary with full benefits might be worth $85,000-$95,000 in total compensation, equivalent to $41-$46/hour.

A freelancer earning $50/hour sounds like more, but after self-employment tax (15.3%), health insurance ($500+/month), no paid vacation, and no retirement match, the true comparison is much closer.

## What Is a Living Wage?

The MIT Living Wage Calculator estimates what a person actually needs to earn to cover basic expenses. In 2026, a single adult with no children needs roughly $18-$22/hour in lower-cost areas and $25-$35/hour in expensive metro areas.

For a family of four with one working parent, the living wage ranges from $30/hour in affordable areas to $50+/hour in cities like San Francisco or New York.

## Evaluating a Job Offer

Don't just compare base salary numbers. Calculate the effective hourly rate including expected overtime and commute time.

A $60,000 job with strict 40-hour weeks = $28.85/hour. The same $60,000 with expected 50-hour weeks = $23.08/hour. If that job also requires a 1-hour daily commute (10 hours/week), your time-adjusted rate is closer to $20/hour.

Meanwhile, a $55,000 remote job at 40 hours/week with no commute = $26.44/hour of your actual time — arguably a better deal.
