  - q: "What is the formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius?"
    a: "°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9. Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature, then multiply by 5/9."
  - q: "What is the formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?"
    a: "°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32. Multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5 (or 1.8), then add 32."
  - q: "What temperature is the same in both Fahrenheit and Celsius?"
    a: "-40 degrees is the same in both scales. -40°F = -40°C. It's the only point where the two scales intersect."
  - q: "Why does the US use Fahrenheit?"
    a: "The US adopted Fahrenheit in the colonial era from Britain. While most countries switched to Celsius as part of the metric system, the US never made the full transition. Fahrenheit remains standard for weather and cooking in the US."

You're traveling in Europe and the weather app says it's 22°C outside. Is that warm enough for shorts? Or should you grab a jacket? If you grew up with Fahrenheit, Celsius can feel like a foreign language.

Whether you're traveling, cooking with a foreign recipe, or just curious, here's how to convert between the two temperature scales — including some tricks so you can do it in your head.

## The Conversion Formulas

There are two formulas you need:

**Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9

**Celsius to Fahrenheit:**
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

**Example — 72°F to Celsius:**
- (72 - 32) × 5/9 = 40 × 0.556 = **22.2°C**

**Example — 30°C to Fahrenheit:**
- (30 × 9/5) + 32 = 54 + 32 = **86°F**

## Quick Reference Chart

Here are the conversions you'll use most often:

| Fahrenheit | Celsius | Context |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 32°F | 0°C | Water freezes |
| 50°F | 10°C | Cool — need a jacket |
| 59°F | 15°C | Mild — light layers |
| 68°F | 20°C | Comfortable room temp |
| 72°F | 22°C | Ideal indoor temperature |
| 77°F | 25°C | Warm and pleasant |
| 86°F | 30°C | Hot summer day |
| 95°F | 35°C | Very hot |
| 100°F | 37.8°C | Normal body temperature |
| 104°F | 40°C | Heat wave / fever |
| 212°F | 100°C | Water boils |
| 350°F | 177°C | Common baking temperature |
| 400°F | 204°C | High baking temperature |
| 450°F | 232°C | Pizza oven temperature |

## Mental Math Tricks

You don't need exact precision for most situations. These shortcuts get you close enough:

**Quick Fahrenheit to Celsius:** Subtract 30, then divide by 2.
- 80°F → (80 - 30) ÷ 2 = **25°C** (actual: 26.7°C — close enough!)
- 50°F → (50 - 30) ÷ 2 = **10°C** (actual: 10°C — perfect!)

**Quick Celsius to Fahrenheit:** Double it, then add 30.
- 20°C → (20 × 2) + 30 = **70°F** (actual: 68°F — close!)
- 35°C → (35 × 2) + 30 = **100°F** (actual: 95°F — reasonable estimate)

These shortcuts are accurate within a few degrees — more than good enough for deciding what to wear.

## Temperature Scales for Cooking

Cooking with international recipes requires accurate conversion. Here are common oven temperatures:

| Gas Mark | Fahrenheit | Celsius | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 2 | 300°F | 150°C | Slow |
| 4 | 350°F | 180°C | Moderate |
| 5 | 375°F | 190°C | Moderately hot |
| 6 | 400°F | 200°C | Hot |
| 7 | 425°F | 220°C | Hot |
| 8 | 450°F | 230°C | Very hot |
