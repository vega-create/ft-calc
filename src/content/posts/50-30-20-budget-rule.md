  - q: "What is the 50/30/20 rule?"
    a: "The 50/30/20 rule says to spend 50% of your after-tax income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and debt repayment."
  - q: "Should I use gross or net income for the 50/30/20 rule?"
    a: "Use your net (after-tax) income — the amount that actually hits your bank account. This gives you a realistic budget based on what you can actually spend."
  - q: "What if my rent alone takes 50% of my income?"
    a: "In high-cost cities, the 50% needs category may not be realistic. Consider adjusting to 60/20/20 or 70/20/10 while working on increasing income. The key is having a system."
  - q: "Does the 50/30/20 rule work for everyone?"
    a: "It's a great starting point, but not one-size-fits-all. People with high debt, low income, or aggressive savings goals may need different ratios. The principle of intentional allocation is what matters most."

Marcus brings home $4,500 per month after taxes. He pays his bills, buys what he wants, and by the 25th, the account is nearly empty. Every month feels like a financial scramble. He doesn't overspend on anything crazy — but somehow, there's never enough left over.

If this sounds familiar, the 50/30/20 rule might be exactly what you need. It's the simplest budgeting framework that actually works.

## How the 50/30/20 Rule Works

Take your monthly after-tax income and divide it into three buckets:

**50% → Needs** — Things you must pay for to survive and function.

**30% → Wants** — Things that improve your life but aren't essential.

**20% → Savings & Debt** — Building your financial future.

For Marcus with $4,500/month:
- Needs: $2,250
- Wants: $1,350
- Savings/Debt: $900

## What Counts as a Need?

Needs are expenses you can't avoid. If you stopped paying, your life would genuinely be affected:

- Rent or mortgage payment
- Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet)
- Groceries (basic food, not dining out)
- Health insurance and medical costs
- Car payment and gas (if needed for work)
- Minimum debt payments
- Basic phone plan
- Childcare

**The key test:** If you lost your job, would you still need to pay this to survive? If yes, it's a need.

## What Counts as a Want?

Wants are everything that makes life enjoyable but isn't strictly necessary:

- Dining out and takeout
- Streaming subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify)
- Gym membership
- Shopping for clothes beyond basics
- Vacations and travel
- Hobbies and entertainment
- Upgraded phone plan
- That $6 daily latte

**No judgment.** Wants aren't wasteful — they're part of a balanced life. The goal is keeping them within your 30% budget.

## The 20% Savings and Debt Category

This is where wealth gets built:

- Emergency fund (aim for 3-6 months of expenses)
- 401(k) or IRA contributions
- Extra debt payments (beyond minimums)
- Investment accounts
- Saving for major goals (house down payment, education)

**Priority order:**
1. Employer 401(k) match (free money — always take it)
2. Emergency fund to $1,000
3. Pay off high-interest debt (credit cards)
4. Build emergency fund to 3-6 months
5. Invest for retirement and other goals

## Real Example: $60,000 Salary

On a $60,000 annual salary, your take-home pay is roughly $3,900/month (assuming standard deductions and taxes).

| Category | Amount | Examples |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Needs (50%) | $1,950 | Rent $1,200 + Utilities $150 + Groceries $300 + Insurance $200 + Gas $100 |
| Wants (30%) | $1,170 | Dining $300 + Entertainment $150 + Subscriptions $50 + Shopping $200 + Gym $50 + Misc $420 |
| Savings (20%) | $780 | 401k $400 + Emergency fund $200 + Extra debt payment $180 |

## When 50/30/20 Doesn't Quite Fit

The framework may need adjusting based on your situation:

**High cost of living:** In San Francisco or New York, rent alone might exceed 50%. Try 60/20/20 or 70/15/15. Focus on keeping savings at 15%+ minimum.

**High debt load:** If you're aggressively paying off student loans or credit cards, try 50/20/30 — flipping wants and savings. Temporary sacrifice for long-term freedom.

**High income:** If you earn well, consider 40/20/40 — reducing needs, keeping wants modest, and supercharging savings.
