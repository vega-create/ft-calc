  - q: "What is a healthy body fat percentage for men?"
    a: "For men, 10-20% body fat is generally considered healthy. Athletes may be 6-13%, fit individuals 14-17%, and average adults 18-24%. Above 25% is considered overweight."
  - q: "What is a healthy body fat percentage for women?"
    a: "For women, 18-28% body fat is generally considered healthy. Female athletes may be 14-20%, fit individuals 21-24%, and average adults 25-31%. Above 32% is considered overweight."
  - q: "Why do women need more body fat than men?"
    a: "Women's bodies require higher essential fat (10-13%) compared to men (2-5%) for hormone production, reproductive health, and organ protection. This biological difference is completely normal."
  - q: "Is body fat percentage better than BMI?"
    a: "Body fat percentage gives a more accurate picture of health than BMI because it distinguishes between fat and muscle. A muscular person can have a high BMI but low body fat, which BMI misses entirely."

Jake weighed 185 pounds and his BMI said "overweight." His friend Ryan also weighed 185 at the same height — also "overweight" by BMI standards. But Jake was a competitive CrossFit athlete with visible abs, while Ryan hadn't exercised in years. Same weight, completely different bodies. That's why body fat percentage matters more than the number on the scale.

## What Is Body Fat Percentage?

Body fat percentage is the proportion of your total body weight that comes from fat tissue. The rest is lean mass — muscle, bone, organs, water, and everything else.

**Formula:** Body Fat % = (Fat Mass ÷ Total Body Weight) × 100

A 180-pound man with 30 pounds of fat has a body fat percentage of 16.7%. The remaining 150 pounds is lean mass.

## Body Fat Ranges by Category

**Men:**

| Category | Body Fat % |
|:---|:---:|
| Essential fat | 2-5% |
| Athletes | 6-13% |
| Fitness | 14-17% |
| Average | 18-24% |
| Overweight | 25%+ |

**Women:**

| Category | Body Fat % |
|:---|:---:|
| Essential fat | 10-13% |
| Athletes | 14-20% |
| Fitness | 21-24% |
| Average | 25-31% |
| Overweight | 32%+ |

These ranges shift slightly with age — it's natural and healthy to carry somewhat more fat as you get older.

## How to Estimate Body Fat

There are several methods, ranging from free to expensive:

**Navy Method (free, reasonably accurate):** Uses neck and waist measurements for men; neck, waist, and hip measurements for women. Our [body fat calculator](/body-fat/) uses this method — just grab a tape measure.

**Skinfold calipers ($10-30):** A trained person pinches skin at multiple body sites and measures the fold thickness. Accuracy depends heavily on the person doing the measurement.

**Bioelectrical impedance (BIA):** Found in smart scales and handheld devices. Convenient but accuracy varies with hydration levels. Best used to track trends over time rather than absolute numbers.

**DEXA scan ($50-150):** The gold standard. Uses X-rays to measure bone, fat, and lean tissue precisely. Available at clinics and some gyms.

## Why Body Fat Percentage Matters More Than Weight

Two people at 160 pounds can look completely different:

**Person A:** 160 lbs, 15% body fat = 24 lbs of fat, 136 lbs of lean mass. Looks fit and toned.

**Person B:** 160 lbs, 30% body fat = 48 lbs of fat, 112 lbs of lean mass. Looks soft, less defined.

The scale can't tell you which you are. Neither can BMI. Body fat percentage can.

This also explains why the scale sometimes goes up when you start exercising — you're gaining muscle (which is denser than fat) while losing fat. Your body composition improves even if your weight stays the same or increases slightly.

## How to Lower Body Fat Percentage

The principles are straightforward:

**Eat in a moderate calorie deficit** — 300-500 calories below your TDEE. Use our [calorie calculator](/calorie/) to find your number.

**Prioritize protein** — 0.7-1g per pound of body weight helps preserve muscle while losing fat.

**Strength train** — Lifting weights signals your body to keep muscle and burn fat. Cardio alone tends to reduce both.

**Be patient** — Healthy fat loss is 0.5-1% body fat per month. Crash diets burn muscle along with fat, which wrecks your body composition.

## Track Your Progress

Start with our free [body fat calculator](/body-fat/) to get your baseline estimate. Pair it with your [BMI](/bmi/) and [calorie needs](/calorie/) for a complete health snapshot.
