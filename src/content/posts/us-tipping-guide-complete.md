  - q: "Is 15% still an acceptable restaurant tip?"
    a: "15% is considered the minimum for adequate service. The current standard is 18-20% for good service, and 20-25% for exceptional service. In expensive cities like New York or San Francisco, 20% is the baseline expectation."
  - q: "Should I tip on the pre-tax or post-tax amount?"
    a: "Traditionally, tipping is based on the pre-tax subtotal. However, many people tip on the total including tax for simplicity. The difference is usually small — on a $50 meal with 8% tax, it's about $0.80 difference at a 20% tip."
  - q: "Do I tip on takeout orders?"
    a: "Tipping on takeout is optional but increasingly common since COVID-19. 10-15% is appreciated for takeout, especially if the order is large or complex. For a quick pickup of a simple order, no tip is expected but a few dollars is a nice gesture."
  - q: "Can I tip with a credit card?"
    a: "Yes, but cash tips are generally preferred by service workers because they receive them immediately and in full. Some establishments deduct credit card processing fees from tips, though this practice varies by state law."

You're visiting the US for the first time. The check arrives at the restaurant. Your meal was $47.50, and now you're staring at the tip line wondering if you're about to commit a social faux pas.

Or maybe you're American and still not sure what to tip the hotel housekeeper, the hairdresser, or the Uber driver. You're not alone — tipping culture is complicated, inconsistent, and constantly changing.

Here's the definitive guide.

## Restaurant Tipping

**Sit-down restaurants:** 18-20% of the pre-tax bill is standard for good service. For exceptional service, 20-25%. For poor service, 15% (never zero — if service was truly terrible, speak to a manager).

**Buffets:** 10-15%. Someone is still clearing plates, refilling drinks, and maintaining the buffet.

**Counter service / fast casual:** 0-15%. Tipping at counter service places is optional. The tip screen at checkout creates social pressure, but there's no obligation.

**Bartenders:** $1-2 per drink for beer/wine, $2-3 per cocktail, or 18-20% of a tab.

**Takeout:** 0-15%. Increasingly common post-COVID. Tip more for large or complex orders.

## Delivery Tipping

**Food delivery (DoorDash, Uber Eats):** $3-5 minimum or 15-20% of the order, whichever is higher. In bad weather, tip more. Remember that drivers use their own gas and car.

**Pizza delivery:** $3-5 for a normal order. $5+ for large orders or long distances. At least $3 even for a single pizza.

**Grocery delivery (Instacart):** 15-20% of the order total. Your shopper is selecting items, carrying heavy bags, and driving to you.

## Personal Services

**Hair salon:** 15-20% of the service cost. If the salon owner cuts your hair, tipping is optional but appreciated.

**Nail salon:** 15-20%. Cash is strongly preferred.

**Massage:** 15-20% of the service price.

**Spa services:** 15-20%. Check if gratuity is included.

**Tattoo artists:** 15-25%. For large pieces, some people bring food or drinks as well.

## Travel Tipping

**Hotel housekeeping:** $2-5 per night. Leave it daily (different staff may clean each day) with a note saying "Thank you" so they know it's a tip.

**Hotel bellhop:** $1-2 per bag, minimum $3-5.

**Hotel concierge:** $5-20 depending on the complexity of help provided (restaurant reservations vs. hard-to-get tickets).

**Valet parking:** $3-5 when your car is returned.

**Taxi/rideshare:** 15-20%. Many ride-share apps make this easy with post-ride tipping.

**Tour guides:** $5-10 per person for group tours, more for private tours.

## Quick Mental Math

The easiest way to calculate a tip: find 10% by moving the decimal point, then adjust.

For $47.50: 10% is $4.75. For 20%, double it: $9.50. For 15%, add half of 10% to 10%: $4.75 + $2.38 = $7.13.
