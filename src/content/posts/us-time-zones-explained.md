faq:
  - q: "How many time zones does the US have?"
    a: "The contiguous US has 4 time zones: Eastern (EST/EDT), Central (CST/CDT), Mountain (MST/MDT), and Pacific (PST/PDT). Including Alaska and Hawaii, there are 6 total."
  - q: "What time is it in California when it's 3 PM in New York?"
    a: "California (Pacific) is 3 hours behind New York (Eastern). So 3 PM in New York is 12 PM (noon) in California."
  - q: "When does daylight saving time start and end?"
    a: "In the US, clocks spring forward on the second Sunday of March and fall back on the first Sunday of November. Arizona and Hawaii do not observe daylight saving time."
  - q: "What does UTC mean?"
    a: "UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the global time standard that all time zones are measured from. Eastern Standard Time is UTC-5, meaning 5 hours behind UTC."

You're scheduling a video call with your team — one person is in New York, another in Chicago, and a third in Los Angeles. What time works for everyone? If you've ever stared at your screen trying to do this math, you're not alone.

## The Four Main US Time Zones

The contiguous United States spans four time zones, each one hour apart:

| Time Zone | Abbreviation | UTC Offset | Major Cities |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Eastern | EST (EDT) | UTC-5 (-4) | New York, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Washington DC |
| Central | CST (CDT) | UTC-6 (-5) | Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Nashville, New Orleans |
| Mountain | MST (MDT) | UTC-7 (-6) | Denver, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque |
| Pacific | PST (PDT) | UTC-8 (-7) | Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland |

**The quick rule:** When moving west, subtract one hour per zone. When moving east, add one hour.

So if it's **3:00 PM Eastern**, it's:
- 2:00 PM Central
- 1:00 PM Mountain
- 12:00 PM Pacific

## Quick Conversion Cheat Sheet

| Eastern | Central | Mountain | Pacific |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 9 AM | 8 AM | 7 AM | 6 AM |
| 10 AM | 9 AM | 8 AM | 7 AM |
| 12 PM | 11 AM | 10 AM | 9 AM |
| 1 PM | 12 PM | 11 AM | 10 AM |
| 3 PM | 2 PM | 1 PM | 12 PM |
| 5 PM | 4 PM | 3 PM | 2 PM |
| 8 PM | 7 PM | 6 PM | 5 PM |

## Daylight Saving Time (DST)

Twice a year, most of the US shifts its clocks:

**Spring Forward:** Second Sunday in March — clocks jump from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM. You lose one hour of sleep.

**Fall Back:** First Sunday in November — clocks go from 2:00 AM back to 1:00 AM. You gain one hour.

During DST, the abbreviations change: EST becomes EDT, CST becomes CDT, etc. The "D" stands for "Daylight."

**Exceptions:** Arizona (except the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii do NOT observe daylight saving time. They stay on standard time year-round. This means Arizona is on the same time as Pacific during summer and Mountain during winter.

## Scheduling Across Time Zones

**The sweet spot for coast-to-coast meetings:** 12 PM - 2 PM Eastern (9 AM - 11 AM Pacific). This window falls within normal business hours for both coasts.

**Bad meeting times to avoid:**
- Before 12 PM Eastern = before 9 AM Pacific (too early for the West Coast)
- After 5 PM Pacific = after 8 PM Eastern (too late for the East Coast)

## Beyond the Contiguous US

| Territory | Time Zone | UTC Offset |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| Alaska | AKST/AKDT | UTC-9 (-8) |
| Hawaii | HST | UTC-10 |
| Guam | ChST | UTC+10 |
| Puerto Rico | AST | UTC-4 |

Hawaii is 5 hours behind Eastern and 2 hours behind Pacific. Alaska is 4 hours behind Eastern and 1 hour behind Pacific.
