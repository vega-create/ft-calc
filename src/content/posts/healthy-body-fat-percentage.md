  - q: "What's the difference between BMI and body fat percentage?"
    a: "BMI uses only height and weight, so a muscular person might have a high BMI but low body fat. Body fat percentage directly measures how much of your weight is fat versus lean tissue, making it a more accurate health indicator."
  - q: "Can you have too little body fat?"
    a: "Yes. Essential body fat is about 2-5% for men and 10-13% for women. Going below these levels is dangerous and can cause hormonal disruption, organ damage, immune system failure, and for women, loss of menstrual cycles."
  - q: "Why do women need more body fat than men?"
    a: "Women's bodies require higher essential fat for reproductive health, hormone production, and breast tissue. This biological difference means a healthy woman at 25% body fat and a healthy man at 15% body fat are at equivalent fitness levels."
  - q: "What is the most accurate way to measure body fat?"
    a: "DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scans are the gold standard, accurate to within 1-2%. Hydrostatic weighing is also very accurate. Calipers are reasonably accurate with a skilled tester. Bathroom smart scales using bioelectrical impedance are convenient but can vary by 3-5%."

Step on a scale and you get one number. But that number doesn't tell you whether your 180 pounds is mostly muscle or mostly fat. Two people can weigh exactly the same but look completely different and have vastly different health risks.

That's why body fat percentage matters more than weight alone.

## What Is Body Fat Percentage?

Body fat percentage is the proportion of your total weight that consists of fat. If you weigh 180 pounds and have 20% body fat, you're carrying 36 pounds of fat and 144 pounds of lean mass (muscle, bone, water, organs).

Your body has two types of fat. Essential fat is the minimum needed for basic health — it cushions organs, insulates nerves, and enables hormone production. Storage fat is the extra energy your body has saved, stored beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat) and around organs (visceral fat).

## Healthy Ranges by Gender

**Men** have lower essential fat requirements. Healthy body fat ranges for men are: Athletes 6-13%, Fitness 14-17%, Acceptable 18-24%, Obese 25%+.

**Women** carry more essential fat for reproductive and hormonal health. Healthy ranges for women are: Athletes 14-20%, Fitness 21-24%, Acceptable 25-31%, Obese 32%+.

## How Age Affects Body Fat

Body fat naturally increases with age as muscle mass declines. A healthy 25-year-old man at 15% body fat and a healthy 55-year-old man at 22% body fat are both within normal ranges.

For men in their 20s, 10-20% is healthy. In their 30s-40s, 12-22%. In their 50s-60s, 15-25%.

For women in their 20s, 18-28% is healthy. In their 30s-40s, 20-30%. In their 50s-60s, 22-33%.

## Why Visceral Fat Is the Danger

Not all body fat is created equal. Subcutaneous fat (under the skin) is relatively benign. Visceral fat (around organs in the abdominal cavity) is the dangerous type — it's metabolically active and linked to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and certain cancers.

You can be "skinny fat" — normal weight with low muscle mass and high visceral fat — and face serious health risks that BMI alone won't reveal.

Waist circumference is a quick proxy for visceral fat. For men, a waist over 40 inches (102 cm) signals elevated risk. For women, over 35 inches (89 cm).

## How to Reduce Body Fat

**Strength training** is the most effective long-term strategy. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, so building muscle raises your metabolic rate.

**Protein intake** should be 0.7-1 gram per pound of body weight. Protein preserves muscle during fat loss and keeps you feeling full longer.

**Moderate calorie deficit** of 500 calories below your TDEE produces about 1 pound of fat loss per week. Larger deficits risk muscle loss. Learn more about TDEE in our [BMR vs. TDEE guide](/blog/bmr-vs-tdee-explained).

**Sleep** matters more than most people realize. Poor sleep increases cortisol and ghrelin (hunger hormone), making fat loss harder. Aim for 7-9 hours.

## Measure and Track

Use our free [Body Fat Calculator](/body-fat) to estimate your body fat percentage using the US Navy method. Pair it with our [BMI Calculator](/bmi) and [Calorie Calculator](/calorie) for a complete picture of your body composition and nutrition needs.
