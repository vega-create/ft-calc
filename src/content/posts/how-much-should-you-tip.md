You're finishing a great dinner at a new restaurant. The bill comes to $86.40. You pull out your phone, open the calculator, and stare at the screen. Is 18% enough? Should it be on the pre-tax amount? What about the bartender who made your cocktails?

Tipping in America can feel complicated — especially if you didn't grow up with it. This guide makes it simple.

## Restaurant Tipping

Sit-down restaurants are where tipping matters most. Servers in many US states earn a base wage of just $2.13 per hour, with tips making up the majority of their income.

**Standard guidelines:**
- **15%** — Acceptable for adequate service
- **18-20%** — Standard for good service (this is the new baseline for most people)
- **20-25%** — Great service, complex orders, large parties
- **25%+** — Exceptional experience

**Large parties:** Many restaurants add an automatic 18-20% gratuity for groups of 6 or more. Check your bill before adding an additional tip.

**Buffets:** 10-15% is standard, since servers still bring drinks and clear plates.

## Quick Mental Math for Restaurant Tips

Don't want to pull out your phone? Try these shortcuts:

**For 20%:** Move the decimal point one place left (that's 10%), then double it. A $65 bill → $6.50 → doubled = $13 tip.

**For 15%:** Find 10%, then add half. $65 → $6.50 + $3.25 = $9.75 tip.

**For 18%:** Find 20% and subtract a little. $65 → $13 - $1.30 = about $11.70.

Or just use our [tip calculator](/tip/) and skip the math entirely.

## Tipping Guide by Service

Beyond restaurants, here's what's expected across different services in the US:

**Food & Drink:**
- Coffee shop / counter service: $1-2 per order or 10-15%
- Food delivery: 15-20% or $3-5 minimum
- Bartender: $1-2 per drink, or 15-20% of tab
- Takeout: 0-10% (optional, but increasingly common)

**Personal Services:**
- Hairstylist / barber: 15-20%
- Spa / massage: 15-20%
- Nail salon: 15-20%
- Tattoo artist: 15-25%

**Travel & Hospitality:**
- Hotel housekeeper: $2-5 per night
- Bellhop: $1-2 per bag
- Concierge: $5-20 depending on service
- Valet parking: $2-5 when your car is returned

**Home Services:**
- Movers: $20-50 per person or 15-20% of total
- Furniture delivery: $5-20 per person
- Grocery delivery: 15-20% or $5 minimum

## When You Don't Need to Tip

Tipping isn't expected everywhere:

- Fast food restaurants (with no table service)
- Retail stores
- Medical offices
- Government employees
- Business owners who set their own prices (though it's still appreciated)

## The Pre-Tax vs. Post-Tax Debate

The traditional etiquette is to tip on the **pre-tax subtotal** — since the tax goes to the government, not the server. However, many people find it easier to tip on the full amount, and the difference is usually small.

On an $80 pre-tax bill with 8% sales tax ($86.40 total), the difference between 20% on pre-tax ($16) and post-tax ($17.28) is just $1.28. Tip on whichever feels right to you.
