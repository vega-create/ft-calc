  - q: "How do I calculate 30% off a price?"
    a: "Multiply the original price by 0.70 (which is 1 minus 0.30). For example, 30% off $80 = $80 × 0.70 = $56."
  - q: "Does 50% off plus 20% off equal 70% off?"
    a: "No. Stacked discounts are applied sequentially, not added. 50% off then 20% off means: $100 → $50 → $40. That's 60% off total, not 70%."
  - q: "How do I find what percentage I'm saving?"
    a: "Subtract the sale price from the original price, divide by the original price, multiply by 100. Example: was $120, now $84 → (120-84) ÷ 120 × 100 = 30% off."
  - q: "Is it a good deal if it's marked up before being discounted?"
    a: "Watch out for inflated 'original' prices. Retailers sometimes raise prices before a sale to make discounts look bigger. Compare the sale price to what you'd normally expect to pay, not just the listed original price."

Black Friday: "70% OFF EVERYTHING!" You grab three items, head to checkout, and the total is somehow still $180. How is that possible? Understanding discount math protects your wallet from misleading sales tactics.

## Basic Discount Calculation

The simplest discount calculation:

**Sale Price = Original Price × (1 - Discount Rate)**

Or if you prefer: **Sale Price = Original Price - (Original Price × Discount %)**

**Example:** A $95 jacket at 40% off:
- $95 × (1 - 0.40) = $95 × 0.60 = **$57**
- You save: $95 - $57 = $38

**Quick shortcut:** To find the price after discount, just multiply by the "keep" percentage:
- 20% off → multiply by 0.80
- 25% off → multiply by 0.75
- 30% off → multiply by 0.70
- 40% off → multiply by 0.60
- 50% off → multiply by 0.50

## Stacked Discounts (The Tricky Part)

"Take an extra 20% off already reduced items!" Sounds amazing, but the math isn't what most people think.

**The wrong way:** 40% off + 20% off = 60% off ❌

**The right way:** Apply each discount sequentially.

**Example:** $100 item, 40% off then extra 20% off:
1. First discount: $100 × 0.60 = $60
2. Second discount: $60 × 0.80 = **$48**
3. Actual total discount: ($100 - $48) ÷ $100 = **52% off**

That's 52% off, not 60%. The difference adds up when you're spending hundreds of dollars.

**Quick formula for stacked discounts:**
Total discount = 1 - (first multiplier × second multiplier)
= 1 - (0.60 × 0.80) = 1 - 0.48 = 52%

## Finding the Original Discount Percentage

Sometimes you see a sale tag but want to know the actual percentage off:

**Discount % = ((Original - Sale Price) ÷ Original) × 100**

**Example:** Was $249, now $179:
- ($249 - $179) ÷ $249 × 100 = **28.1% off**

This is useful when stores just show the sale price without stating the percentage.

## Sales Tax After Discount

Remember: sales tax is calculated on the discounted price, not the original price. That's one small benefit of buying on sale.

**Example:** $80 item at 25% off in a state with 8% sales tax:
- Discounted price: $80 × 0.75 = $60
- Tax: $60 × 0.08 = $4.80
- **Total: $64.80**

## "Buy One Get One" Deals Decoded

BOGO deals aren't always 50% off:
- **BOGO Free** — Buy 1, get 1 free = 50% off if you buy exactly 2
- **BOGO 50% off** — Buy 1, get 1 at half price = 25% off per item
- **Buy 2 Get 1 Free** — 33% off per item (if you buy exactly 3)

The real question is whether you actually need the extra items. A "deal" on something you don't need isn't a deal — it's spending.
