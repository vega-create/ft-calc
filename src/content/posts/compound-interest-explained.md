faq:
  - q: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?"
    a: "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal. Compound interest is calculated on the principal plus all previously earned interest, so your money grows faster over time."
  - q: "How often does compound interest get calculated?"
    a: "It depends on the account. Banks may compound daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. More frequent compounding means slightly more growth."
  - q: "How much will $10,000 grow in 10 years at 7% compound interest?"
    a: "With annual compounding, $10,000 at 7% for 10 years grows to approximately $19,672. That's nearly double your original investment."
  - q: "Does compound interest work against me with debt?"
    a: "Yes. Credit card debt compounds too — unpaid interest gets added to your balance, and you start paying interest on interest. That's why high-interest debt is so expensive."

Sarah opened a savings account at 22 with $5,000 and forgot about it. At 52 — thirty years later — she checked the balance and found over $38,000. She hadn't added a single dollar. The secret? Compound interest at 7% annual return, quietly multiplying her money year after year.

That's the power of compound interest. Let's break down exactly how it works.

## What Is Compound Interest?

Compound interest is interest calculated on both your initial deposit (the principal) and all the interest you've already earned. It's "interest on interest" — and it's the reason long-term investing works so well.

Here's the formula:

**A = P × (1 + r/n)^(n×t)**

Where:
- **A** = Final amount
- **P** = Principal (starting amount)
- **r** = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
- **n** = Number of times compounded per year
- **t** = Number of years

## Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest

The difference becomes dramatic over time.

Let's say you invest $10,000 at 8% for 20 years:

**Simple interest:** $10,000 + ($10,000 × 0.08 × 20) = **$26,000**

**Compound interest (annual):** $10,000 × (1.08)^20 = **$46,610**

That's an extra $20,610 — and you didn't do anything differently. The compound interest earned almost twice as much because each year's interest earned its own interest.

## The Rule of 72

Want a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money? Divide 72 by your interest rate.

**Years to double = 72 ÷ Interest Rate**

Examples:
- At 6% → 72 ÷ 6 = **12 years** to double
- At 8% → 72 ÷ 8 = **9 years** to double
- At 10% → 72 ÷ 10 = **7.2 years** to double
- At 12% → 72 ÷ 12 = **6 years** to double

## Why Starting Early Matters So Much

The biggest factor in compound interest isn't the rate — it's time.

Consider two people who each invest $5,000 per year at 8% return:

**Alex starts at age 25**, invests for 10 years (until 35), then stops. Total invested: $50,000.

**Jordan starts at age 35**, invests for 30 years (until 65). Total invested: $150,000.

At age 65: Alex has approximately **$787,000**. Jordan has approximately **$611,000**.

Alex invested three times less money but ended up with more — because those extra 10 years of compounding made all the difference.

## How Compounding Frequency Affects Growth

More frequent compounding means slightly more growth. Here's $10,000 at 8% for 10 years with different compounding frequencies:

- **Annually:** $21,589
- **Quarterly:** $21,911
- **Monthly:** $22,196
- **Daily:** $22,253

The difference between annual and daily compounding is about $664 on a $10,000 investment over 10 years. It matters more with larger amounts and longer timeframes.

## Compound Interest in Real Life

Compound interest shows up in many places:

**Savings accounts** — Your bank pays interest on your balance, including previously earned interest.

**401(k) and IRA** — Investment returns compound over decades, which is why retirement accounts grow so dramatically.

**Index funds** — The S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually. At that rate, $10,000 becomes $174,000 in 30 years.

**Credit card debt** — This is compound interest working against you. A $5,000 balance at 24% APR, paying only minimums, can take 20+ years to pay off and cost you $8,000+ in interest.

## How to Take Advantage of Compound Interest

The strategy is simple: start early, be consistent, and be patient.

Even small amounts matter. Investing just $200 per month at 8% for 30 years turns into over $298,000 — from only $72,000 in contributions. The rest is compound interest.
