  - q: "How do I calculate what percentage one number is of another?"
    a: "Divide the part by the whole, then multiply by 100. For example, 25 out of 200 is (25 ÷ 200) × 100 = 12.5%."
  - q: "How do I find the percentage increase between two numbers?"
    a: "Subtract the old number from the new number, divide by the old number, and multiply by 100. Example: from 80 to 100 is ((100-80) ÷ 80) × 100 = 25% increase."
  - q: "What is 20% of 150?"
    a: "Multiply 150 by 0.20 to get 30. So 20% of 150 is 30."

Imagine you're at the store staring at a "35% off" sign, trying to figure out the actual price in your head. Or maybe your boss just told you that revenue grew "by 18% this quarter" and you're nodding along, not entirely sure what that means in real dollars. Percentages are everywhere — and once you understand the basics, they're surprisingly simple.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about calculating percentages, with clear examples you can actually use.

## What Is a Percentage?

A percentage is just a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word itself comes from Latin — "per centum" — meaning "by the hundred." So when you see 45%, it literally means 45 out of every 100.

Here's the core formula:

**Percentage = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100**

That's it. Every percentage problem is some variation of this formula.

## Three Types of Percentage Problems

Most real-world percentage questions fall into one of three categories. Let's walk through each one.

### Type 1: What Is X% of Y?

This is the most common one — finding a specific percentage of a number.

**Formula:** Result = (Percentage ÷ 100) × Number

**Example:** What is 15% of 200?
- 15 ÷ 100 = 0.15
- 0.15 × 200 = **30**

You'd use this when calculating tips, discounts, tax amounts, or commission rates.

### Type 2: X Is What Percent of Y?

Here you know the part and the whole, and you need to find the percentage.

**Formula:** Percentage = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100

**Example:** You scored 42 out of 50 on a test. What percentage is that?
- 42 ÷ 50 = 0.84
- 0.84 × 100 = **84%**

### Type 3: X Is Y% of What Number?

This is the reverse calculation — you know the percentage and the result, but need to find the original number.

**Formula:** Whole = Part ÷ (Percentage ÷ 100)

**Example:** 30 is 25% of what number?
- 30 ÷ (25 ÷ 100) = 30 ÷ 0.25 = **120**

## How to Calculate Percentage Increase and Decrease

Percentage change shows how much something has grown or shrunk relative to its original value.

**Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) ÷ Old Value) × 100**

A positive result means an increase. A negative result means a decrease.

**Example — Increase:** Your rent went from $1,200 to $1,350.
- (1,350 - 1,200) ÷ 1,200 × 100 = **12.5% increase**

**Example — Decrease:** Gas dropped from $4.00 to $3.40 per gallon.
- (3.40 - 4.00) ÷ 4.00 × 100 = **-15% decrease**

## Quick Mental Math Tricks

You don't always need a calculator. These shortcuts help:

**Finding 10%:** Just move the decimal point one place to the left. 10% of $85 = $8.50.

**Finding 5%:** Find 10% first, then halve it. 5% of $85 = $4.25.

**Finding 20%:** Find 10% and double it. 20% of $85 = $17.

**Finding 15% (great for tips):** Find 10% + half of 10%. For an $85 bill: $8.50 + $4.25 = $12.75 tip.

## Real-World Applications

Percentages show up constantly in daily life. Here are the most common situations:

**Shopping discounts** — A $60 shirt at 30% off costs $60 × 0.70 = $42.

**Restaurant tips** — 18% on a $55 meal: $55 × 0.18 = $9.90.

**Sales tax** — 8.5% tax on a $299 laptop: $299 × 0.085 = $25.42, total = $324.42.

**Salary raise** — 4% raise on $65,000: $65,000 × 0.04 = $2,600 raise, new salary = $67,600.

**Grade calculations** — 87 correct out of 100 questions = 87%.
