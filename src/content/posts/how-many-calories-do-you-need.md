  - q: "How many calories should I eat per day to lose weight?"
    a: "A safe calorie deficit is 500 calories below your TDEE, which leads to about 1 pound of weight loss per week. For most adults, this means eating between 1,500-2,000 calories per day, but the exact number depends on your size and activity level."
  - q: "What is TDEE?"
    a: "TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure — the total number of calories your body burns in a day including exercise. It combines your BMR (basic body functions) plus calories burned through activity."
  - q: "Do I need to count calories to be healthy?"
    a: "Not necessarily. Calorie counting is a useful tool for specific goals like weight loss or muscle gain, but many people maintain a healthy weight through intuitive eating and portion awareness. It's one approach, not the only one."
  - q: "Are all calories the same?"
    a: "In terms of pure energy, yes — a calorie is a calorie. But in terms of nutrition, satiety, and health effects, the source matters enormously. 300 calories of chicken and vegetables keeps you full far longer than 300 calories of candy."

Emily started a new diet and cut down to 1,200 calories a day. She was hungry all the time, couldn't focus at work, and quit after two weeks. The problem wasn't willpower — she was eating far less than her body actually needed.

Knowing your calorie needs isn't about obsessive counting. It's about understanding the basic math of energy so you can make informed choices.

## What Is a Calorie?

A calorie is a unit of energy. Your body needs energy to do everything — breathe, think, walk, digest food, even sleep. The food you eat provides that energy, measured in calories.

Every person needs a different number of calories based on their body size, age, sex, and how active they are.

## Step 1: Calculate Your BMR

BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the number of calories your body burns just to stay alive — heartbeat, breathing, brain function, cell repair. Even if you stayed in bed all day, you'd burn this many calories.

**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (most accurate):**

- Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

**Example — 30-year-old woman, 5'5" (165 cm), 145 lbs (66 kg):**
- BMR = (10 × 66) + (6.25 × 165) - (5 × 30) - 161
- BMR = 660 + 1,031 - 150 - 161 = **1,380 calories/day**

That means her body burns 1,380 calories just to function — before any movement or exercise.

## Step 2: Factor In Activity Level (TDEE)

Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is your BMR multiplied by an activity factor:

| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Sedentary | 1.2 | Desk job, little exercise |
| Lightly active | 1.375 | Light exercise 1-3 days/week |
| Moderately active | 1.55 | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week |
| Very active | 1.725 | Hard exercise 6-7 days/week |
| Extremely active | 1.9 | Athlete or very physical job |

**For our example (moderately active):**
- TDEE = 1,380 × 1.55 = **2,139 calories/day**

This is her maintenance level — eating this amount keeps her weight stable.

## Calorie Goals Based on Your Objective

**To lose weight:** Eat 300-500 calories below your TDEE. A 500-calorie deficit leads to roughly 1 pound of fat loss per week.

**To maintain weight:** Eat at your TDEE.

**To gain muscle:** Eat 200-400 calories above your TDEE, combined with strength training.

**For our example:**
- Weight loss: 2,139 - 500 = **1,639 calories/day**
- Maintenance: **2,139 calories/day**
- Muscle gain: 2,139 + 300 = **2,439 calories/day**

Notice that 1,639 is still well above the 1,200 that Emily was struggling with. Extreme restriction isn't necessary — and usually backfires.

## Why Extreme Calorie Cutting Backfires

When you eat too little, your body responds by:

**Slowing your metabolism** — Your BMR drops as your body tries to conserve energy.

**Increasing hunger hormones** — Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) spikes, making cravings intense.

**Burning muscle** — Without adequate protein and calories, your body breaks down muscle tissue for energy.

**Reducing energy** — You feel tired, foggy, and irritable.

The minimum recommended intake is generally 1,200 calories for women and 1,500 for men — and even those numbers feel restrictive for most people. A moderate deficit of 300-500 below TDEE is more sustainable and preserves muscle mass.

## Quality Matters as Much as Quantity

Two people eating 2,000 calories a day can have very different health outcomes depending on what they eat. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that keep you full:

**High satiety:** Lean protein, vegetables, whole grains, beans, fruits, nuts (in moderation).

**Low satiety:** Sugary drinks, candy, chips, ultra-processed snacks — they go down easy but don't keep you satisfied.

A practical approach is to build meals around protein and vegetables first, then add carbs and fats to fill out your calorie target.
