faq:
  - q: "What temperature is the same in both Fahrenheit and Celsius?"
    a: "-40 degrees is the same in both scales. This is the only point where Fahrenheit and Celsius intersect."
  - q: "What is normal body temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius?"
    a: "Normal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), though individual normal ranges vary from about 97°F to 99°F (36.1°C to 37.2°C). A fever is generally considered 100.4°F (38°C) or higher."
  - q: "Why does the US use Fahrenheit?"
    a: "Daniel Fahrenheit's scale was widely adopted in English-speaking countries in the 1700s. When most of the world switched to Celsius in the mid-20th century, the US chose not to mandate the change, though Celsius is used in US science and medicine."
  - q: "What's the fastest way to estimate Celsius to Fahrenheit?"
    a: "Double the Celsius number and add 30. It's not exact but works well for everyday temperatures. Example: 20°C → (20×2)+30 = 70°F (actual: 68°F). Close enough for deciding what to wear."

Is 25°C warm enough for shorts? Is 180°C the right oven temperature for chicken? What does it mean when the weather app abroad says "it feels like -5"?

If you've ever traveled internationally or followed a recipe from another country, you've hit the Fahrenheit-Celsius wall. Here's how to break through it.

## The Conversion Formulas

**Fahrenheit to Celsius:** (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C. So 72°F: (72-32) × 5/9 = 40 × 0.556 = 22.2°C.

**Celsius to Fahrenheit:** (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F. So 25°C: (25 × 1.8) + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77°F.

Those formulas are precise but hard to do in your head. Use these shortcuts instead.

## The Quick Estimation Trick

**Celsius to Fahrenheit:** Double it and add 30. This gives you a surprisingly close estimate for everyday temperatures. 10°C → 50°F (exact: 50°F, perfect). 20°C → 70°F (exact: 68°F). 30°C → 90°F (exact: 86°F). 35°C → 100°F (exact: 95°F).

**Fahrenheit to Celsius:** Subtract 30, then halve it. 70°F → 20°C (exact: 21.1°C). 90°F → 30°C (exact: 32.2°C). It gets less accurate at extremes, but for weather temperatures it works great.

## Weather Reference Points

Here's what common Celsius temperatures feel like in Fahrenheit terms:

-10°C (14°F) is bitterly cold — heavy winter coat, gloves, hat mandatory. 0°C (32°F) is freezing — literally, water turns to ice. 10°C (50°F) is cool — light jacket weather. 20°C (68°F) is comfortable room temperature. 25°C (77°F) is warm and pleasant. 30°C (86°F) is hot — summer day. 35°C (95°F) is very hot — stay hydrated. 40°C (104°F) is dangerously hot — heat advisory territory.

## Cooking Temperatures

Oven temperatures are where Fahrenheit-Celsius confusion causes the most practical problems.

150°C = 300°F (low/slow cooking). 180°C = 350°F (standard baking — cookies, cakes). 200°C = 400°F (roasting vegetables, chicken). 220°C = 425°F (high-heat roasting, pizza). 230°C = 450°F (bread, high-heat searing).

For meat doneness: Rare beef is 125°F (52°C). Medium is 145°F (63°C). Well-done is 160°F (71°C). Chicken must reach 165°F (74°C) for food safety.

## Medical Temperatures

Normal body temperature: 98.6°F (37°C). Low-grade fever: 99-100.3°F (37.2-37.9°C). Fever: 100.4°F+ (38°C+). High fever requiring medical attention: 103°F+ (39.4°C+). Hypothermia: below 95°F (35°C).

For children, always consult a pediatrician for fevers over 100.4°F (38°C) in infants under 3 months.
