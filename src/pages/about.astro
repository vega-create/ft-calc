      <p>FreeToolkit Calculator provides free, fast, and accurate online calculators for everyday use. Whether you need to split a restaurant bill, calculate your BMI, figure out a loan payment, or convert units, we've got you covered.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We believe essential calculation tools should be free, fast, and accessible to everyone. No sign-ups, no downloads, no ads blocking your results. Just type your numbers and get instant, accurate answers.</p>

      <h2>How Our Calculators Work</h2>
      <p>All calculations happen directly in your browser using JavaScript. Your data never leaves your device — we don't store, track, or transmit any numbers you enter. This means our tools work even when you're offline (after the initial page load).</p>

      <h2>Accuracy</h2>
      <p>Our calculators use industry-standard formulas and methods. The BMI calculator follows WHO guidelines. The compound interest calculator uses the standard compounding formula. The calorie calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, widely regarded as the most accurate predictive equation for estimating resting metabolic rate.</p>
      <p>While we strive for accuracy, please note that calculators provide estimates and should not replace professional advice. Always consult qualified professionals for financial, medical, or legal decisions.</p>

      <h2>Categories</h2>
