    <h2>How to Use the Tip Calculator</h2>
    <p>Enter your bill amount, select or type a tip percentage, and optionally set how many people are splitting the bill. The calculator shows the tip amount, total bill, and per-person cost instantly.</p>

    <h3>Quick Tip Presets</h3>
    <p>Use the preset buttons for the most common tip amounts: 15% for adequate service, 18% for good service, 20% for great service, and 25% for exceptional service. You can also type any custom percentage.</p>

    <h3>Bill Splitting</h3>
    <p>Dining with friends? Use the split feature to divide the total evenly. Adjust the number of people using the plus and minus buttons or type a number directly.</p>

    <h2>US Tipping Guide</h2>
    <p>Tipping customs vary by service type. For sit-down restaurants, 18-20% is standard. For delivery drivers, 15-20% or at least $3-5 per order is common. For hair stylists and barbers, 15-20% of the service cost is customary. For taxi and rideshare drivers, 15-20% is appreciated.</p>

    <h2>Mental Math Tip Tricks</h2>
    <p>For quick mental math: to calculate 10%, just move the decimal one place left. For 20%, double the 10% amount. For 15%, find 10% and add half of that. For example, on a $64 bill, 10% is $6.40, so 20% is $12.80 and 15% is $9.60.</p>
