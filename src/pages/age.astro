    <h2>How to Use the Age Calculator</h2>

    <h2>What This Calculator Shows</h2>
    <p>Beyond the standard years-months-days breakdown, this tool displays the total number of days you've been alive and how many days remain until your next birthday. It accounts for leap years and varying month lengths to give you precise results.</p>
    <h2>Fun Age Facts</h2>
    <p>On your 10,000th day alive, you're about 27 years and 5 months old. Your 1 billionth second of life occurs at roughly age 31 years and 8 months. These milestones make fun alternative celebrations beyond traditional birthdays.</p>
