  { q: "Is the cheapest unit price always the best deal?", a: "Not necessarily. Consider whether you can use all of a larger quantity before it expires, and whether storage space is available." },
  { q: "How do stores calculate unit prices?", a: "Stores divide the total price by the quantity. For example, a 32oz bottle for $3.99 has a unit price of $0.125/oz." }
