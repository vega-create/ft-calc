  { q: "What is the difference between percentage and percentile?", a: "A percentage represents a portion out of 100 (like scoring 85% on a test). A percentile indicates where a value falls in a distribution (like being in the 90th percentile means you scored higher than 90% of test-takers)." },
  { q: "How do I find what percentage one number is of another?", a: "Divide the part by the whole and multiply by 100. For example, 30 is what percent of 200? Answer: (30 ÷ 200) × 100 = 15%." },

    <h2>How to Use the Percentage Calculator</h2>
    <p>This percentage calculator handles three common calculations. Switch between modes using the tabs above the input fields.</p>

    <h3>% of Number</h3>
    <p>Find a percentage of any number. Enter the percentage in the first field and the number in the second field. For example, to find 15% of 200, enter 15 and 200. The calculator instantly returns 30.</p>

    <h3>% Change</h3>
    <p>Calculate the percentage increase or decrease between two values. Enter the original value first, then the new value. A positive result means an increase; a negative result means a decrease. This is useful for tracking price changes, salary increases, or investment returns.</p>

    <h3>What % Is?</h3>
    <p>Determine what percentage one number represents of another. For instance, if you scored 42 out of 50 on a test, enter 42 and 50 to find that your score is 84%.</p>

    <h2>Percentage Formula Reference</h2>
    <p>The three formulas used in this calculator are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Percentage of a number:</strong> Result = (Percentage ÷ 100) × Number</li>
      <li><strong>Percentage change:</strong> Change = ((New − Old) ÷ Old) × 100</li>
      <li><strong>What percent:</strong> Percent = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Percentage Calculations</h2>
    <p>Percentages appear everywhere in daily life. You use them when calculating sales tax, figuring out discounts while shopping, determining tip amounts at restaurants, understanding interest rates on loans, and interpreting statistics in the news. This calculator makes all these calculations quick and error-free.</p>
