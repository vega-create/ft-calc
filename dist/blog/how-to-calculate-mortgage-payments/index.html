The real estate agent told them to “just run the numbers,” but neither of them had any idea how mortgage math actually works. If you’ve ever stared at a listing price wondering what your actual monthly payment would be, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>Understanding mortgage calculations doesn’t require a finance degree — just a few key concepts and a good calculator.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-up-a-mortgage-payment">What Makes Up a Mortgage Payment</h2>
<p>Your monthly mortgage payment has four components, known as PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Principal</strong> is the portion that actually pays down your loan balance. In the early years of a mortgage, this is surprisingly small — most of your payment goes toward interest.</p>
<p><strong>Interest</strong> is what the bank charges you for borrowing money. On a $300,000 loan at 7%, you’d pay roughly $21,000 in interest during just the first year.</p>
<p><strong>Property taxes</strong> vary by location but typically run between 0.5% and 2.5% of your home’s value annually. A $350,000 home in Texas might have $8,750 in annual property taxes, while the same home in Hawaii might only owe $1,225.</p>
<p><strong>Homeowners insurance</strong> protects your property and usually costs $1,000 to $3,000 per year depending on coverage and location.</p>
<h2 id="the-mortgage-payment-formula">The Mortgage Payment Formula</h2>
<p>The core formula for calculating monthly principal and interest is:</p>
<p><strong>M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n – 1]</strong></p>
<p>Where M is your monthly payment, P is the loan principal, r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12), and n is the total number of payments.</p>
<p>For a $280,000 loan (after a 20% down payment on $350,000) at 7% interest over 30 years: the monthly principal and interest payment comes to approximately $1,863.</p>
<p>Add roughly $400 for taxes and $150 for insurance, and the total monthly payment is around $2,413.</p>
<h2 id="how-down-payment-affects-your-payment">How Down Payment Affects Your Payment</h2>
<p>The down payment directly reduces your loan amount and can eliminate private mortgage insurance (PMI). Here’s how different down payments affect a $350,000 home at 7% interest:</p>
<p>A 5% down payment ($17,500) means borrowing $332,500, resulting in roughly $2,212 monthly for principal and interest, plus PMI of about $140/month.</p>
<p>A 10% down payment ($35,000) reduces the loan to $315,000, dropping the payment to about $2,096 plus PMI of around $105/month.</p>
<p>A 20% down payment ($70,000) brings the loan to $280,000 and a payment of $1,863 — with no PMI required.</p>
<h2 id="15-year-vs-30-year-comparison">15-Year vs. 30-Year Comparison</h2>
<p>A shorter loan term means higher monthly payments but dramatically less total interest. On a $280,000 loan at 7%:</p>
<p>The 30-year option gives you a $1,863 monthly payment but you’ll pay $390,680 in total interest over the life of the loan.</p>
<p>The 15-year option bumps the payment to $2,517 monthly, but total interest drops to $173,060 — saving you over $217,000.</p>
<h2 id="smart-strategies-for-lower-payments">Smart Strategies for Lower Payments</h2>
<p><strong>Improve your credit score</strong> before applying. Going from a 670 to a 740 score could save you 0.5% on your rate, which on a $280,000 loan saves roughly $100/month.</p>
<p><strong>Shop multiple lenders.</strong> Rates can vary by 0.25% to 0.75% between lenders on the same day. Always get at least three quotes.</p>
<p><strong>Consider buying points.</strong> Paying 1% of your loan amount upfront can reduce your rate by about 0.25%. This makes sense if you plan to stay in the home for 5+ years.</p>
<p><strong>Look into first-time buyer programs.</strong> Many states offer down payment assistance or reduced-rate mortgages for qualified buyers.</p>
