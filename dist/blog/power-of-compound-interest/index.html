Wait until 35 to start the same investment, and you’d end up with only about $395,000. That 10-year delay cost you over $700,000 — even though you only missed $12,000 in actual contributions.</p>
<p>This is the magic of compound interest, and understanding it is the single most important financial concept you’ll ever learn.</p>
<h2 id="how-compound-interest-works">How Compound Interest Works</h2>
<p>Simple interest pays you only on your original deposit. If you invest $1,000 at 10% simple interest, you earn $100 every year — forever.</p>
<p>Compound interest pays you on your original deposit plus all the interest you’ve already earned. That same $1,000 at 10% compound interest earns $100 the first year, $110 the second year, $121 the third year, and keeps accelerating.</p>
<p>After 30 years, that $1,000 with simple interest would be worth $4,000. With compound interest, it would be worth $17,449. Same starting amount, same interest rate — but compounding produced more than four times the result.</p>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-72">The Rule of 72</h2>
<p>Want a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money? Divide 72 by your interest rate.</p>
<p>At 6% return, your money doubles every 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12). At 8%, it doubles every 9 years. At 10%, every 7.2 years. At 12%, every 6 years.</p>
<p>This means $10,000 invested at 10% becomes $20,000 in about 7 years, $40,000 in 14 years, $80,000 in 21 years, and $160,000 in 28 years — without adding a single extra dollar.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-scenarios">Real-World Scenarios</h2>
<p><strong>The early starter:</strong> Investing $200/month from age 22 to 65 at 8% average return gives you approximately $945,000. Total invested: $103,200. Interest earned: $841,800.</p>
<p><strong>The late starter:</strong> Investing $400/month from age 35 to 65 at 8% gives you approximately $589,000. Total invested: $144,000. Interest earned: $445,000.</p>
<p>The early starter invested less money but ended up with 60% more, because those extra 13 years of compounding made an enormous difference.</p>
<p><strong>The coffee trade:</strong> Skipping a $5 daily coffee and investing it instead ($150/month) from age 25 to 65 at 9% average return produces about $884,000. Your lattes literally cost you nearly a million dollars.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-maximize-compound-interest">How to Maximize Compound Interest</h2>
<p><strong>Start immediately.</strong> The single most important factor is time. Even $50/month is better than waiting until you can afford $500/month.</p>
<p><strong>Reinvest everything.</strong> If your investments pay dividends, reinvest them automatically. Every dollar reinvested starts compounding on its own.</p>
<p><strong>Increase contributions over time.</strong> If you get a 3% raise, put at least 1% of it toward your investments. You won’t miss it, but your future self will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize fees.</strong> A 1% management fee might sound small, but over 30 years it can eat 25–30% of your total returns. Choose low-cost index funds when possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-side-of-compounding">The Dark Side of Compounding</h2>
<p>Compound interest works against you with debt. A $10,000 credit card balance at 22% APR with minimum payments takes over 30 years to pay off and costs over $23,000 in interest — more than double the original balance.</p>
<p>This is why paying off high-interest debt should always be your first priority before investing.</p>
