Your monthly payment is $387. Seems reasonable, right? But by the end of the loan, you’ll have paid $23,199 — over $3,000 more than you borrowed.</p>
<p>That extra $3,199 is the true cost of borrowing, and most people never think about it when signing loan papers. Understanding how interest works puts you in control.</p>
<h2 id="how-interest-is-calculated">How Interest Is Calculated</h2>
<p>Most loans use simple interest on the remaining balance. Each month, the bank calculates: Monthly Interest = Remaining Balance × (Annual Rate ÷ 12).</p>
<p>On a $20,000 loan at 6%: first month’s interest is $20,000 × (0.06 ÷ 12) = $100. Your $387 payment covers that $100 in interest, and the remaining $287 reduces your principal to $19,713.</p>
<p>Next month, interest is calculated on $19,713 instead of $20,000: $19,713 × 0.005 = $98.57. So $288.43 goes to principal. Each month, more money goes to principal and less to interest.</p>
<h2 id="the-amortization-schedule">The Amortization Schedule</h2>
<p>This gradual shift from interest-heavy to principal-heavy payments is called amortization. On a 30-year mortgage, the shift is dramatic.</p>
<p>On a $300,000 mortgage at 7%, your first payment of $1,996 breaks down as $1,750 in interest and only $246 in principal. After 15 years of payments (halfway through the loan), you’ve paid about $359,000 but still owe $234,000 — you’ve only reduced your balance by $66,000.</p>
<p>This is why early extra payments are so powerful. An extra $200/month in the first year saves far more total interest than $200/month in year 25.</p>
<h2 id="apr-vs-interest-rate">APR vs. Interest Rate</h2>
<p>The interest rate is the base cost. APR includes origination fees, closing costs, discount points, and other charges, spread over the loan’s life.</p>
<p>A mortgage might have a 6.5% interest rate but a 6.8% APR after fees. A personal loan might advertise 8% interest but have a 12% APR after the 3% origination fee.</p>
<p>Always compare loans using APR, not the advertised interest rate. It’s the only honest apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-vs-variable-rates">Fixed vs. Variable Rates</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed rate</strong> stays the same for the entire loan term. Your payment is predictable, which makes budgeting easy. Best when interest rates are low or you want certainty.</p>
<p><strong>Variable rate</strong> (adjustable rate) starts lower but can change based on market conditions. An ARM mortgage might start at 5.5% but could rise to 8%+ after the initial fixed period.</p>
<p>Variable rates are riskier but can save money if rates drop or if you plan to pay off the loan quickly.</p>
<h2 id="strategies-to-pay-less-interest">Strategies to Pay Less Interest</h2>
<p><strong>Make biweekly payments.</strong> Instead of 12 monthly payments, make 26 half-payments per year. This sneaks in one extra full payment annually, which on a 30-year mortgage can save 4-6 years and tens of thousands in interest.</p>
<p><strong>Round up payments.</strong> If your payment is $387, pay $400. That extra $13/month on a $20,000 car loan saves about $200 in interest and pays off the loan 3 months early.</p>
<p><strong>Refinance when rates drop.</strong> If rates fall 0.75-1% below your current rate, refinancing often makes sense. Run the numbers to ensure savings exceed closing costs.</p>
<p><strong>Attack highest-rate debt first.</strong> If you have multiple loans, the “avalanche method” — paying extra toward the highest interest rate loan — minimizes total interest paid.</p>
