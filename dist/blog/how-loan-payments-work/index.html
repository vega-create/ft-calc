Your monthly payment is $1,996. Over 30 years, you’ll pay a total of $718,527 — more than double the original loan amount. Wait, what?</p>
<p>It sounds shocking, but that’s exactly how amortization works. Understanding it is the key to making smarter borrowing decisions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-amortization">What Is Amortization?</h2>
<p>Amortization is the process of paying off a loan through regular, equal payments over a set period. Each payment is split between two things: interest (what the bank charges you for borrowing) and principal (reducing what you actually owe).</p>
<p>The twist is that the split changes over time. Early payments are mostly interest. Later payments are mostly principal.</p>
<h2 id="why-early-payments-are-mostly-interest">Why Early Payments Are Mostly Interest</h2>
<p>Interest is calculated on your remaining balance. When you start a loan, your balance is at its maximum — so the interest charge is at its maximum too.</p>
<p><strong>Example — Month 1 of a $300,000 loan at 7%:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly interest rate: 7% ÷ 12 = 0.583%</li>
<li>Interest charge: $300,000 × 0.00583 = <strong>$1,750</strong></li>
<li>Your payment: $1,996</li>
<li>Amount going to principal: $1,996 - $1,750 = <strong>$246</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the first month, 87.7% of your payment goes to interest. Only 12.3% reduces your debt.</p>
<p><strong>Fast forward to Month 300 (year 25):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remaining balance: about $107,000</li>
<li>Interest charge: $107,000 × 0.00583 = <strong>$624</strong></li>
<li>Amount going to principal: $1,996 - $624 = <strong>$1,372</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now 68.7% goes to principal. The balance shrinks faster and faster as you progress.</p>
<h2 id="the-total-cost-of-borrowing">The Total Cost of Borrowing</h2>
<p>The interest rate determines how much extra you pay over the life of the loan.</p>
<p>For a <strong>$300,000 mortgage:</strong></p>









































<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Term</th><th align="center">Rate</th><th align="center">Monthly Payment</th><th align="center">Total Interest Paid</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">30 years</td><td align="center">6%</td><td align="center">$1,799</td><td align="center">$347,515</td></tr><tr><td align="center">30 years</td><td align="center">7%</td><td align="center">$1,996</td><td align="center">$418,527</td></tr><tr><td align="center">30 years</td><td align="center">8%</td><td align="center">$2,201</td><td align="center">$492,476</td></tr><tr><td align="center">15 years</td><td align="center">6%</td><td align="center">$2,532</td><td align="center">$155,683</td></tr><tr><td align="center">15 years</td><td align="center">7%</td><td align="center">$2,696</td><td align="center">$185,367</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>A single percentage point difference on a 30-year mortgage costs roughly $70,000 in extra interest.</p>
<h2 id="how-extra-payments-save-you-thousands">How Extra Payments Save You Thousands</h2>
<p>Making extra payments — even small ones — directly reduces your principal, which means less interest accrues in every future month. The effect snowballs.</p>
<p><strong>$300,000 mortgage at 7%, 30 years:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normal payoff: 30 years, $418,527 in interest</li>
<li>Extra $100/month: Paid off in 25.5 years, saves <strong>$56,000</strong> in interest</li>
<li>Extra $200/month: Paid off in 22.5 years, saves <strong>$98,000</strong> in interest</li>
<li>Extra $500/month: Paid off in 17.5 years, saves <strong>$175,000</strong> in interest</li>
</ul>
<p>Even rounding up your payment to the nearest hundred can shave years off your loan.</p>
<h2 id="amortization-applies-to-all-loans">Amortization Applies to All Loans</h2>
<p>The same principle works for car loans, student loans, and personal loans — any loan with fixed payments.</p>
<p><strong>Auto loan example:</strong> A $35,000 car loan at 6.5% for 5 years has a monthly payment of $685. Total interest paid: $6,100. If you extend to 7 years, the payment drops to $520 but total interest rises to $8,700.</p>
<p><strong>Student loans:</strong> Federal student loans typically have 10-year repayment terms. Extending to 25 years lowers payments but dramatically increases total interest.</p>
